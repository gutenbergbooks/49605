<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>Brazil is preparing to commemorate worthily the centenary
of her independence. The world outside is bidden
to the feast, and to beautiful Rio de Janeiro many
nations are sending their envoys with felicitations and
gifts. Our own country, the United States of North
America, is mindful of her duty and her privilege on
this occasion, and accredited delegates are bearing her
congratulations to her ever-faithful associate in the promoting
of peace and fraternity throughout the Western
Hemisphere. Perhaps it will not be taken amiss, if the
scholar and critic add his testimonial to the expressions
of good-will coming from all sides. What more fitting
than that a scholar and critic of our United States
should join the chorus and voice an honest appreciation
of Brazilian letters?</p>

<p>Dr. Goldberg, who has already paid ample tribute to
the literary output of Spanish-speaking America, gives
proof now of the catholicity of his interest by surveying
the whole course of literature in Portuguese-speaking
America, the vast land of Brazil, and by analyzing the
compositions of certain outstanding figures among the
writers of the region. He knows at first hand the authors
and the works that he treats; he knows what native
and foreign critics have to say about them; he expresses
unreservedly his own opinion about them. He
gives praise where praise is due, and, in kindly fashion,
he puts stricture upon that which calls for stricture.
On the whole, his pages contain more laudation than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
censure; and this is as it should be, for very many of the
literary achievements of colonial, imperial and republican
Brazil are unquestionably of lasting worth. His laudation,
moreover, is uttered without any tinge of that condescension
which European critics deem it incumbent upon
them to manifest when they pass judgment on the culture
of North or South America.</p>

<p>To his fellow-citizens of the United States of North
America Dr. Goldberg now presents an opportunity of
viewing aspects of the soul of a noble Southern land,
their constant ally. Brazil’s political and commercial importance
they know well, but her literary significance
has not been so evident to them. If, reading his words,
they conceive respect for Brazilian effort and accomplishment
in the world of letters, his reward will be truly
great; and that reward is truly deserved.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The plans for this book, as well as for my <i>Studies
in Spanish-American Literature</i>, were conceived during
the years 1910-1912 while I was engaged in research
work under Professor J. D. M. Ford, head of the Department
of Romance Languages, Harvard University.
It was not merely that text-books were lacking
in both the Spanish-American and the Brazilian fields, for
my interest is centred upon aesthetic pleasure rather
than upon the depersonalized transmission of facts. A
yawning gap of ignorance separated us then from the
America that does not speak English, nor was the ignorance
all on our side. Commercial opportunities,
more than cultural curiosity, served to impart an impetus
to the study of Spanish and soon we were reading
fiction not only from Spain but from Spanish America.
In so far as the mercantile spirit was responsible for this
broader literary interest, it performed an undoubted
service to art by widening our horizons, but one should
be wary about overestimating the permanent gain. Unfortunately,
the phonographic iteration of diplomatic
platitudes brings continents no nearer, unless it be for
the mad purposes of war. If, then, we are, as a people,
quite as far as ever from Spanish America, what shall
we say of our spiritual distance from the United States
of Brazil?</p>

<p>I may be pardoned if I indicate, for example, that
the language of Brazil is not Spanish, but Portuguese.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
And should this simple fact come as a surprise to any
reader, let him not be unduly overwhelmed, for he errs
in distinguished company. Thus, Gustave Le Bon,&mdash;he
of crowd-psychology fame, speaks of South America
in his <i>Lois psychologiques des peuples</i> (p. 131, 12th
ed., 1916) as being predominantly of <i>Spanish</i> origin,
divided into numerous republics, of which the <i>Brazilian</i>
is one. As late as 1899, Vacher de Lapouge, in his
book on <i>L’Aryen</i> could describe Brazil as a “vast negro
state returning to a state of savagery,” important, like
Mexico, only in a numerical way.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A small return, it
seems, for Brazil’s intellectual adherence to France, yet
indicative of inexcusable ignorance not only of Brazil,
but of Mexico, where the cultural life, though concentrated,
is intense and productive of results that would
repay examination. By 1899 Brazil had already produced
a fairly respectable array of original creative
writers, while Mexican poetry was adding to the wealth
of new Spanish verse. Where specialists stray, then,
who shall guide the innocent layman? Nor are the
Brazilians without their case against the English, as we
shall presently note in the discussion of a mooted section
of Buckle’s <i>History of Civilization in England</i>,
though they owe to more than one earlier Englishman
a history of their land. Robert Southey, for notable
example, after the collapse of the “pantisocratic”
plans harboured by him and Coleridge, found the time to
write a <i>History of Brazil</i> that is read today only somewhat
less frequently than his poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of Brazil, like Cæsar’s unforgettable
Gaul, is generally divided into three parts: (1) from
the discovery by the Portuguese in 1500 to the Independence
in 1822; (2) the independent monarchy, which
lasted until 1889; (3) the republic, 1889 to the present.
This, then, is the centenary year of Brazilian independence
and, as no English book has yet sought to trace the
literary history of the nation, the occasion seems propitious
for such a modest introductory one as this.
The fuller volume which it precedes I hope to have ready
in a few years, as a contribution to the study of the
creative imagination on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>If, in any part, I seem dogmatic, I can but plead the
exigencies of space, which permit of little analytic discussion.
I am no believer in clear-cut formulæ as applied
to art; where facts are presented, they are given
as succinctly as possible, while opinions are meant to
be suggestive rather than&mdash;ugly word!&mdash;definitive.
The first part of the book is devoted to an outline history
of Brazilian literature; this is meant to provide the
background for a proper appreciation of the representative
figures treated in the second part. Since the first
part deals largely with facts, I have aimed to give the
reader not solely a personal view&mdash;which belongs
more properly among the essays of the second&mdash;but
also a digest of the few authorities that have treated
the subject. It thus forms a reasonably adequate introduction
to the deeper study of Brazilian literature
that may some day interest a portion of our student
body, and will, moreover, be of aid in rounding out
the sharp corners of a general knowledge of letters.
More important still, it should help to an appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
of the Brazilian national personality. As to the representative
figures chosen for more individual treatment,
through one trait or another they emerge from the background
as Brazil’s contributions to something more than
an exclusively national interest, or else afford striking
opportunity for studying phases of the national mind.</p>

<p>Though none of the text as it here appears has been
printed elsewhere, some of the matter has formed the
substance of articles that have been published, between
1914 and the present, in the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>,
the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, the <i>Literary Review</i> of
the <i>New York Evening Post</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>,
the <i>Bookman</i>, the <i>Stratford Journal</i> and other periodicals,
to the management and editors of which I am indebted
not only for permission to reprint, but for their
readiness to accept such exotic material. For bibliographical
aid and other favours I am also thankful to the
Brazilian Academy of Letters, Carlos de Laet, President;
to Manoel de Oliveira Lima, of the Brazilian Academy;

Memorial Library, Washington, D. C.; C. K. Jones;
Prof. H. R. Lang, Yale; Dr. A. C. Potter and the Harvard
Library; to Sr. Helio Lobo, Consul General in New
York for Brazil; and to my friend Professor J. D. M.
Ford of Harvard. For the index I am indebted to my

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Although Brazil was not discovered until the
opening year of the sixteenth century, the name
had long hovered in the mediaeval consciousness
together with that of those other mysterious
islands which peopled the maps and the imaginations
of the dark, fantastic days. Down from the Greeks
had come the legend of an Atlantis, which, through
the centuries assumed changing shapes, losing soon
its status as continent and becoming an island. Thus,
in a map of the Atlas Medicis, dating back to
1351, there is registered a Brazil. The name varied
from Braçir, Brazil, Brazylle to O’Brasile, and the
position shifted with equal instability; now the mythical
island was near the Azores, now near the western coast
of the British Isles. Charles Squire, in his <i>The Mythology
of the British Islands</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> relates that according to legend,
the gods having lost their celestial dwelling, deliberated
upon some earthly substitute. Into their discussion
came a paradise beyond the sea,&mdash;a western island
variously described as a land of promise, of felicity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of youth, and as the “island of Breasal” or “Hy-Breasail.”
It is supposed that some of the early discoverers,
imagining that they had come upon the island Eden,
named it Brazil in much the same way that Columbus
named the Indies, considering his quest for India at last
successful.</p>

<p>However this may be, the first name officially given to
Brazil was The Land of the True (or Holy) Cross; only
later did the name Brazil, said to have been bestowed
by King Emanuel of Portugal, replace the pious title.
There is something symbolic in the change; brazil<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is
the name of the reddish dyewood which became so important
commercially that it caused naval combats and
Portuguese-French rivalry, leading to the effective occupation
of the land by the Portuguese. The beam of the
cross yielded to a humbler wood as the national designation,
just as the pious pretensions of the early colonizers
quickly vanished before their impious greed.</p>

<p>The early reports of the newly discovered land lived
up to the paradisical visions that had partly inspired the
quest. Truly here was a land of promise, a terrestrial
paradise that made men dip their pens in milk and
honey when they wrote of its wonders. Vaz de Caminha,
in what has been called the nation’s “baptismal
certificate,” grew rhapsodical in vain; Vespucci,&mdash;he for
whom the American continent was named,&mdash;actually
termed it an earthly paradise, but the Portuguese were
slow to value the new possession; the cross was not a
cross of gold. Nobrega, in 1549, exaggerated the extent
of the new discovery even as others were to exaggerate
the variety and magic of its fauna and flora; he considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that it occupied no less than two-thirds of the
world’s area. Padre Anchieta, the noble leader of the
Jesuits, repeated (1585) Vespucci’s glorification and
thought the new land not inferior to Portugal, and thus
ran the litany of adoration from the topographical pen
of Gabriel Soares to the chronicler Cardim, to the pompous
Rocha Pitta, and&mdash;now with realistic modifications
aplenty&mdash;down to our own day, when Graça Aranha, by
the very title of his novel <i>Chanaan</i>, reveals his conception
of his native country as the Land of Promise. From
the very beginning the new discovery had captivated the
imaginations of the Europeans; to this day its chief
quality is the imagination which Senhor Aranha, in a
speech at the Sorbonne (1913) has distinguished
from the imagination of other peoples. “In Brazil,” he
explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> “the collective trait is the imagination. It
is not the faculty of idealization, nor the creation of life
through esthetic expression, nor the predominance of
thought; it is rather the illusion that comes from the
representation of the universe, the state of magic, in
which reality is dissipated and is transformed into an
image.… The distant roots of this imagination may
be found in the souls of the various races that met amidst
the lavishness of tropical nature. Each people brought
to the fusion its own melancholy. Each, having arrived
with a spirit full of the terror of several gods, with the
anguish of memories of a past forever lost, was possessed
by the indefinable uneasiness of the foreign land. Thus
was developed that implacable sensibility which magnifies
and distorts things, which alternately exalts and depresses
the spirits, which translates anxieties and desires; a
troubled source of poetry and religion, through which
we aspire to the possession of the Infinite, only to lose
ourselves at once in the Nirvana of inaction and day-dreaming.”
Benedicto Costa<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has likened this same
imagination to the Brazilian forest, with its “disorder and
opulence, its vigour and languor; trees that last for centuries
and flowers that bloom but a few moments; lianas
that live upon the sap of other growths; the brilliancy of
orchids, the voices of birds of iridescent coloration, the
heat.… There is in the soul of every Brazilian the
same contrasts that characterize the tropical forest.”<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Brazil, however, is not all forest any more than, intellectually,
it is all tropical confusion. There are
mountains and valleys and extensive coasts, and each
region has a distinguishing influence upon the inhabitant.
Thus the climate of the sertão<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (interior highlands) is
less variable and far more salubrious than that of the
littoral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> “Man here represents perfectly the traits of
the surroundings into which he is born and where he
dwells: the <i>sertanejo</i> (i. e., the inhabitant of the sertão)
is sombre, thin, mistrustful and superstitious, rarely
aggressive, rash in his impulses, as silent as the vast
plains that surround him, calm in gesture, laconic in
speech, and, above all, sunk in an inexpressible melancholy
that is in his eyes, in his mysterious countenance, in
all the rough curves of his agile body, which is rather
slender than muscular. The man of the coast is nervous,
of acute sensibility; he can smile and laugh, he has a
brilliant imagination and is a boisterous, turbulent
thinker; he is an artist, preferring colored images to
abstract ideas; he is slender, of well-proportioned lines,
speaks at his best when improvising, discusses affairs with
the utmost ease, and at times with daring, and generally
respects only his own opinions; he is almost always
proud and bold. The man of the sertão, for example,
is Euclydes da Cunha; the man of the coast, Joaquim
Nabuco.”<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is in connection with the climate of Brazil that her
writers have taken Henry Thomas Buckle to task; the
passages responsible for the trouble occur in Chapter II
of the famous <i>History of Civilization in England</i>, wherein
the investigator considers the “influence exercised by
physical laws over the organization of society and over
the character of individuals.” I quote the original passages
from Buckle, and give the refutation, which was
originally made by the indefatigable polemist Sylvio
Romero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The trade wind, blowing on the eastern coast of South America,
and proceeding from the east, crosses the Atlantic ocean, and
therefore reaches the land charged with the vapours accumulated
in its passage. These vapours, on touching the shore, are, at
periodical intervals, condensed into rain; and as their progress
westward is checked by that gigantic chain of the Andes, which
they are unable to pass, they pour the whole of their moisture on
Brazil, which, in consequence, is often deluged by the most destructive
torrents. This abundant supply, being aided by that
vast river-system peculiar to the eastern part of America, and
being also accompanied by heat, has also stimulated the soil into
an activity unequalled in any other part of the world. Brazil,
which is nearly as large as the whole of Europe, is covered with a
vegetation of incredible profusion. Indeed, so rank and luxuriant
is the growth, that Nature seems to riot in the very wantonness
of its power.… Such is the flow and abundance of life by which
Brazil is marked above all other countries of the earth. But,
amid this pomp and splendour of Nature, no place is left for Man.
He is reduced to insignificance by the majesty with which he is
surrounded. The forces that oppose him are so formidable, that
he has never been able to make head against them, never able to
rally against their accumulated pressure. The whole of Brazil,
notwithstanding its immense apparent advantages, has always
remained entirely uncivilized, its inhabitants, wandering savages,
incompetent to resist these obstacles which the very bounty of
Nature had put in their way.… The mountains are too high
to scale, the rivers are too wide to bridge; everything is contrived
to keep back the human mind, and repress its rising ambition.
It is thus that the energies of Nature have hampered the spirit of
Man. Nowhere else is there so painful a contrast between the
grandeur of the external world and the littleness of the internal.
And the mind, cowed by this unequal struggle, has not only been
unable to advance, but without foreign aid it would undoubtedly
have receded. For even at present, with all the improvements
constantly introduced from Europe, there are no real signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
progress.… These considerations explain why it is, that in the
whole of Brazil there are no monuments even of the most imperfect
civilization; no evidence that the people had, at any period, raised
themselves above the state in which they were found when their
country was first discovered.</p>

</div>

<p>In his <i>Historia da Litteratura Brasileira</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Romero devotes
his third chapter to setting Buckle right. Brazil,
he declares, far from suffering excessive rainfall, is subject
to calamitous and destructive droughts. The Englishman,
who never visited Brazil, errs likewise in his
conception of the country’s natural wonders, which he
exaggerates in the traditional fashion that was handed
down by the earliest comers. Despite the presence of
the Amazon, the rivers in general are small, not the
largest in the world; the mountains, similarly, far from
rearing their crests into unattainable cloudy heights, are
of the fourth and fifth order when compared with their
fellows of the old world or the new. Neither are the
animals in Brazil more gigantic and ferocious than elsewhere.
“Our fauna,” writes Romero, “is neither the
richest nor the most terrible in the world. We haven’t
the elephant, the camel, the hippopotamus, the lion, the
tiger, the rhinoceros, the zebra, the giraffe, the buffalo,
the gorilla, the chimpanzee, the condor and the eagle.”
Buckle speaks of Brazil’s unrivalled fertility as an impediment;
the truth is that her fertility is not unrivalled,
nor is it an impediment. In conclusion, “Buckle is right
in the picture he draws of our backwardness, but wrong
in the determination of its causes.” According to
Romero, three chief reasons are to be adduced; these are
(1) natural, (2) ethnic and (3) moral. To the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
belongs the excessive heat, in conjunction with the
droughts in the major part of the country, as well as the
malignant fevers prevalent on the coast. Chief among
the second is the “relative incapacity” of the three
races that comprise the population. To the last belong
the “historic factors called politics, legislation,
habits, customs, which are effects that afterward act
as causes.”</p>

<p>Ronaldo de Carvalho<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> considers Romero’s reply
somewhat timid, inasmuch as he accepts, erroneously,
many of Buckle’s conclusions. Buckle’s passage “is not,
as it appeared to the illustrious Brazilian writer, ‘true in
a general sense.’ Yet it should ‘be meditated upon by
all Brazilians’, that they may see what a dangerous snare
it is to rely so much, in our inveterate fondness for
things foreign, upon the notions imported from the
intellectual markets on the other side of the Atlantic.…
Buckle’s error consisted in considering the
evolution of peoples solely under the influence of physical
and geographical factors; more enduring than these are
the ethnico-historical factors, which are much more important
and far more powerful than the first.” De
Carvalho adds little to Romero’s refutation, which, in
substance, he repeats. At the time that Buckle’s first
volume was originally published (1857), Brazilian literature
had long entered upon an autonomous career
and was in the throes of Romanticism, which in Brazil
was an era of intense and highly fruitful production.
He can hardly be blamed for his ignorance on this score,
when an authority like Ferdinand Wolf, writing his <i>Le
Brésil Litteraire</i> some six years later, is accused by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
querulous Romero of setting down many laughable exaggerations.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Three ethnic strains have combined to produce the
Brazilian of today: (1) the Portuguese, (2) the native
Indian, (3) the African Negro, who was brought in as a
slave by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The native element, known as the Brazilian-Guarany,
at the time of the discovery knew no metals; they possessed
a rudimentary knowledge of weaving, and some of
them practised ceramics; their instruments were of polished
stone, and their fishing and hunting implements
were of the most primitive. The form of organization
was rough. “Some spoke a rich language of delicate accents
and varied expression; they had traditional customs
and were skilful in the arts of war and peace;
others, however, were coarse, deficient in culture, roaming
in nomadic bands along the coast or amidst the high
sertões. Some respected certain rules of morality and
religion, in which, for example, the family ties were
sacred.…”<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Others dwelt in a certain “embryonic
socialism” which permitted free love and the participation
of woman in masculine pursuits. Ethnologists are
not agreed upon the religious status of the tribes, hovering
between the hypotheses of polytheism and anthropomorphic
animism; the latter is more likely.</p>

<p>The Portuguese came at the height of their national
glory. The sixteenth century, famed among them for
its physical prowess, is also the epoch of Camões, Sá de
Miranda, Bernardim Ribeiro and Gil Vicente. As to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the Negro, his history in Brazil is much the same as that
of the black slave in the United States, except that,
owing to the proportions of interbreeding, the “color
line” is less tightly drawn in the southern republic.</p>

<p>Two chief ethnic periods of formation have been distinguished
in Brazil’s development, the first from the
XVIth century to the end of the XVIIIth; the second,
from the opening of the XIXth century to the present
day. In the first period there was, chiefly, a crossing of
the Portuguese with the Indian (<i>mameluco</i>), of the Portuguese
with the Negro (<i>mulato</i>) and of the Indian
with the Negro (<i>cafuso</i>). Later interbreeding becomes
more complex, owing to the influx of new immigrants
from Europe (Italians and Germans in particular,
and Slavs in the south), and to the abolition of black
slavery. So that the question has arisen whether the future
of the land will be in the hands of the Luso-Brazilian
or the Teuto-Italo-Brazilian. Brazilians naturally favour
the former eventuality and in order to insure dominance
by the Portuguese-Brazilian element propose new
systems of colonization as well as immigration zones.
Romero reached the conclusion that the Brazilian people
did not constitute a race, but rather a fusion. As to
whether this was a good or an evil he answered, in
his “scientificist” way, that it was a fact, and that
this should be sufficient. Since the Indian is fast disappearing
and as traffic in blacks was abolished in 1851,
and slavery in 1888, white predominance seems assured.
“Every Brazilian,” said Romero, “is a mestee, if not
in blood, in ideas.” So that white supremacy, never
an unmixed blessing, does not, and cannot under the circumstances,
imply an unmixed mentality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>What of the effect of this milieu and this racial blend
upon the nation’s tongue and its creative output? The
Brazilian is by nature melancholy, for melancholy is an
attribute of each of the three streams that flow in his
blood. The peculiar, haunting sadness of the Portuguese
lyric muse is summed up in their untranslatable word
“saudade”;<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> both the conquered native and the subjected
black are sad, the first through the bepuzzled contact with
superior natural forces, the second through the wretchedness
of his economic position. It has been recognized
that the climate of Brazil has resulted in a lyrism
sweeter, softer and more passionate than that of the
Portuguese. “Our language,” says Romero, “is more
musical and eloquent, our imagination more opulent.”
So, too, De Carvalho: “Brazilian prosody has more
delicate accents than the Portuguese and numerous interesting
peculiarities.”</p>

<p>In the matter of linguistic modification, as of racial
blend and national psychology, we of the North have
problems similar to those of the Brazilians,&mdash;problems
often enough obscured by unscientific, sentimental fixations
or political dogma. The simple fact is that life,
in language as in biology, is change. Whether we are
concerned with the evolution of English in the United
States, of Spanish in the cluster of Spanish-American
republics, or of Portuguese in Brazil, change is the inevitable
law. For the Spanish of Spanish-America, Remy
de Gourmont, with his insatiable appetite for novelty,
originated the term neo-Spanish. It met with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
opposition from the purists, yet it recognizes the ineluctable
course of speech. The noted Colombian philologist
Rufino Cuervo, in a controversy with the genial
conservative Valera, voiced his belief that the Spanish
of the new world would grow more and more unlike the
parent tongue.<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In the same spirit, if with most unacademic
hilariousness, Mencken has, in <i>The American
Language</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> indicated the lines of cleavage between
English and “American.” Brazilian scholars have naturally
assumed a similar attitude toward their own
language and have, likewise, met with the opposition of
the purists. It does not matter, for the purpose of the
present discussion, whether the linguistic cleavage in any
of the instances here given will eventually prove so
definite as to originate new tongues. Such an outcome
is far less probable today than it was, say, in the epoch
when Latin, through its vulgar form, was breaking up
into the Romance languages. Widespread education
and the printing press are conserving influences, acting
as a check upon capricious modification.</p>

<p>One of the soundest and most sensible documents upon
the Portuguese language in Brazil comes from the pen of
the admirable critic José Verissimo.<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> “As a matter of
fact,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> “save perhaps in the really Portuguese
period of our literature, which merely reproduced in an
inferior fashion the ideas, the composition, the style and
the language of the Portuguese (already entered upon its
decadence), authors never wrote in Brazil as in Portugal;
the masters of language abroad never had disciples
here to rival them or even emulate them.… It
would be a pure absurdity, then, to expect the Brazilian,
the North American or the Spanish-American to write
the classic tongue of his mother country.”</p>

<p>Chaucer wrote “It am I” where we would say “It is I”
and where current colloquial usage, perhaps foreshadowing
the accepted standard of tomorrow, says “It’s me.”
English changes in England; why shall it cease to change
in the United States? And justly, Verissimo asks a
similar question for Brazil. “I have always felt,” he
remarks somewhat farther on, “that the Portuguese
tongue never attained the discipline and the relative grammatical
and lexical fixity that other languages arrived at.
I do not believe that among cultured tongues there is one
that has given rise to so many controversial cases, or to
so many and so diverse contradictions among its leading
writers.” The fight about the collocation of personal
pronouns is waged so earnestly in Brazil that it
has become as funny, in some of its aspects, as the quarrel
of the “lo-istas” and the “le-istas” in Spain. And so
true are Verissimo’s words that as late as March, 1921,
a writer could complain in the <i>Revista do Brazil</i><a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
that “we are at the very height of linguistic bolshevism”;
the very next month, indeed, the editorial board of the
same representative intellectual organ found it necessary
to comment upon the various systems of orthography employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by its contributors and to designate a choice.<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Verissimo, in accordance with A. H. Sayce, takes as his
standard of grammatical correctness that which is “accepted
by the great body of those who speak a language,
not what is laid down by a grammarian.” Still more to
the point, Verissimo, who was a man of exemplary
honesty and fearlessness in a milieu that easily tempts
to flattery and the other social amenities, declares that
“if we are by language Portuguese, if through that tongue
our literature is but a branch of the Portuguese, we have
already almost ceased to be such … because of our
fund of ideas and notions, which were all constituted outside
of Portuguese influence.” The important thing,
then, is “to have something to say, an idea to express, a
thought to transmit. Without this, however deep his
grammatical knowledge of the language, however perfectly
he apes the classics, no man is a writer.” Platitudinous,
perhaps, but how often some platitudes bear
repetition!</p>

<p>The language of Brazil, then, is not the Portuguese
of Lisbon. From the phonological viewpoint there is
less palatalization of the final <i>s</i> and <i>z</i> than is customary
in Portugal; Brazil has a real diphthong <i>ou</i>, which in
Lisbonese has become a close <i>o</i> or the diphthong <i>oi</i>.
Its pronunciation of the diphthong <i>ei</i> is true, whereas
in Lisbon this approximates to <i>ai</i> (with <i>a</i> as in English
<i>above</i>, or like the <i>u</i> of <i>cut</i>). Neither is the grammar
identical with that of Portugal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> “The truth is, that by
correcting ourselves we run the danger of mutilating ideas
and sentiments that are not merely personal. It is no
longer the language that we are purifying; it is our spirit
that we are subjecting to inexplicable servility. To
speak differently is not to speak incorrectly.… To
change a word or an inflexion of ours for a different one
of Coimbra<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is to alter the value of both in favor of
artificial and deceptive uniformity.”<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Brazilianisms, so-called, make their appearance very
early; they are already present in the letters sent by
the Jesuits, as well as in the old chronicles. New plants,
new fruits, new animals compelled new words. Native
terms enriched the vocabulary. Of course, as has happened
with us, often a word for which the new nation
is reproached turns out to be an original importation
from the motherland. One of the oldest documents in
the history of Brazilianisms appeared in Paris during
the first quarter of the XIXth century and is reprinted by
João Ribeiro as a rarity little known to his countrymen; it
formed part of the <i>Introduction à l’Atlas ethnographique
du globe</i>, prepared by Adrien Balbi and covering the
races and languages of the world. The Portuguese section
was entrusted to Domingos Borges de Barros, baron
and later viscount de Pedra Branca, a warm advocate of
Brazilian independence, then recently achieved. This,
according to Ribeiro, is supposed to constitute the “first
theoretical contribution” to the study of Brazilianisms.
It is written in French, and because of its documentary
importance I translate it in good measure:</p>

<p>“Languages reveal the manners and the character of
peoples. That of the Portuguese has the savor of their
religious, martial traits; thus the words <i>honnête</i>, <i>galant</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<i>éate</i>, <i>bizarre</i>, etc., possess a meaning quite different from
that they have in French. The Portuguese tongue
abounds in terms and phrases for the expression of impulsive
movements and strong actions. In Portuguese
one strikes with everything; and when the Frenchman,
for example, feels the need of adding the word <i>coup</i> to
the thing with which he does the striking, the Portuguese
expresses it with the word of the instrument alone.
One says, in French, <i>un coup de pierre</i>; in Portuguese,
<i>pedrada</i> (a blow with a stone); <i>un coup de couteau</i>
is expressed in Portuguese by <i>facada</i> (a knife thrust)
and so on.…</p>

<p>“Without becoming unidiomatic, one may boldly form
superlatives and diminutives of every adjective; this is
done sometimes even with nouns. Harshness of the pronunciation
has accompanied the arrogance of expression.…
But this tongue, transported to Brazil, breathes
the gentleness of the climate and of the character of
its inhabitants; it has gained in usage and in the expression
of tender sentiments, and while it has preserved all its
energy it possesses more amenity.…</p>

<p>“To this first difference, which embraces the generality
of the Brazilian idiom, one must add that of words which
have altogether changed in accepted meaning, as well as
several other expressions which do not exist in the Portuguese
language and which have been either borrowed
from the natives or imported into Brazil by the inhabitants
of the various oversea colonies of Portugal.”</p>

<p>There follow some eight words that have changed
meaning, such, for example, as <i>faceira</i>, signifying lower
jaw in Portugal, but coquette in Brazil; as a matter of
fact, Ribeiro shows that the Portuguese critics who censured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this “Brazilianism” did not know the history of
their own tongue. In the XVIIth century <i>faceira</i> was
synonymous with <i>pelintra</i>, <i>petimêtre</i>, <i>elegante</i> (respectively,
poor fellow, dandy, fashionable youth); it became
obsolete in Portugal, but in Brazil was preserved with
exclusive application to the feminine. The Brazilian
words unknown in Portugal are some fifty in number
upon the Baron’s list.</p>

<p>Costa finds that Portuguese, crossing the Atlantic,
“almost doubled its vocabulary, accepting and assimilating
a mass of words from the Indian and the Negro.
Through the influence of the climate, through the new
ethnic elements,&mdash;the voluptuous, indolent Negro and
Indian, passionate to the point of crime and sacrifice,&mdash;the
pronunciation of Portuguese by the Brazilian acquired,
so to say, a musical modulation, slow, chanting,
soft,&mdash;a language impregnated with poesy and languor,
quite different from that spoken in Portugal.”<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A new milieu and a racial amalgamation that effect
changes in speech are bound soon or late to produce a
new orientation in literature. The question whether that
literature is largely derivative or independent is relatively
unimportant and academic, as is the analogous question
concerning the essential difference of language. The important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
consideration for us is that the law of change is
operating, and that the change is in the direction of independence.
Much has been written upon the subject of
nationalism in art&mdash;too much, indeed,&mdash;and of this, altogether
too large a part has been needlessly obscured by
the fatuities of the narrowly nationalistic mind. There is,
of course, such a thing as national character, though even
this has been overdone by writers until the traits thus
considered have been so stencilled upon popular thought
that they resemble rather caricatures than characteristics.
True nationalism in literature is largely a product of the
writer’s unconscious mind; it is a spontaneous manifestation,
and no intensity of set purpose can create it unless
the psychological substratum is there. For the rest,
literature belongs to art rather than to nationality, to
esthetics rather than to politics and geography.<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
consideration of literature by nations, then, is itself the
province of the historian of ideas; it is, however, a useful
method of co-ordinating our knowledge and of explaining
the personality of a country. If I bring up the matter
here at all it is because such a writer as Sylvio Romero,
intent upon emphasizing national themes, now and again
distorts the image of his subject, mistaking civic virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and patriotic aspiration for esthetic values, or worse still,
deliberately exalting the former over the latter. The
same Romero, for example,&mdash;a volcanic personality who
never erred upon the side of modesty, false or true,&mdash;speaks
thus of his own poetry: “… I initiated the
reaction against Romanticism in 1870.…” And how
did he initiate it? By calling for a poetry in agreement
with contemporary philosophy. Now, it is no more the
business of poetry to agree with contemporary philosophy
than for it to “agree” with contemporary nationalism.
Goethe, reproached for not having taken up arms in the
German War of Liberation, “or at least co-operating as a
poet,” replied that it would have all been well enough to
have written martial verse within sound of the enemy’s
horses; however, “that was not my life and not my business,
but that of Theodor Körner. His war-songs suit
him perfectly. But to me, who am not of a warlike nature
and who have no warlike sense, war-songs would
have been a mask which would have fitted my face very
badly.… I have never affected anything in my poetry.…
I have never uttered anything which I have
not experienced, and which has not urged me to production.
I have only composed love-songs when I have
loved. How could I write songs of hatred without hating!”
Those are the words of an artist; they could not
be understood by the honourable gentleman who not so
long ago complained in the British parliament because
the poet laureate, Mr. Robert Bridges, had not produced
any appropriate war-verse in celebration of the four
years’ madness.</p>

<p>If, then, we note the gradual resurgence of the national
spirit in Brazilian letters, it is primarily as a contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to a study of the nation’s self-consciousness. The fact
belongs to literary history; only when vitalized by the
breath of a commanding personality does it enter the
realm of art. The history of our own United States
literature raises similar problems, which have compelled
the editors of <i>The Cambridge History of American Literature</i>
to make certain reservations. “To write the intellectual
history of America from the modern esthetic
standpoint is to miss precisely what makes it significant
among modern literatures, namely, that for two centuries
the main energy of Americans went into exploration,
settlement, labour for sustenance, religion and statecraft.
For nearly two hundred years a people with the same
traditions and with the same intellectual capacities as their
contemporaries across the sea found themselves obliged
to dispense with art for art.”<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The words may stand
almost unaltered for Brazil. It is indicative, however,
that where this condition favoured prose as against
verse in the United States, verse in Brazil flourished from
the start and bulks altogether too large in the national
output. We may take it, then, as axiomatic that Brazilian
literature is not exclusively national; no literature is, and
any attempt to keep it rigidly true to a norm chosen
through a mistaken identification of art with geography
and politics is merely a retarding influence. Like all derivative
literatures, Brazilian literature displays outside
influences more strongly than do the older literatures with
a tradition of continuity behind them. The history of
all letters is largely that of intellectual cross-fertilization.</p>

<p>From its early days down to the end of the XVIIIth
century, the literature of Brazil is dominated by Portugal;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the land, intellectually as well as economically, is a colony.
The stirrings of the century reach Brazil around 1750,
and the interval from then to 1830, the date of the Romanticist
triumph in France, marks what has been termed
a transitional epoch. After 1830, letters in Brazil display
a decidedly autonomous tendency (long forecast,
for that matter, in the previous phases), and exhibit that
diversity which has characterized French literature since
the Romantics went out of power. For it is France that
forms the chief influence over latter-day Brazilian letters.
So true is this that Costa, with personal exaggeration,
can write: “I consider our present literature, although
written in Portuguese, as a transatlantic branch of the
marvellous, intoxicating French literature.”<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> There
can be no doubt as to the immense influence exercised upon
the letters of Spanish and Portuguese America by France.
A Spanish cleric,<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> author of an imposing fourteen-volume
history of Spanish literature on both shores of the
Atlantic, has even made out France as the arch villainess,
who with her wiles has always managed to corrupt the
normally healthy realism of the Spanish soul. Only yesterday,
in Brazil, a similar, if less ingenious, attack was
launched against the same country on the score of its denationalizing
effect. Yet it is France which was chiefly responsible
for that modernism (1888-) which infused
new life into the language and art of Spanish America,
later (1898) affecting the motherland itself. And if literary
currents have since, in Spanish America, veered to a
new-world attitude, so are they turning in Brazil. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
this to the realization that Art has no nationality is a forward
step; some day it will be taken. As in the United
States, so in Brazil, side by side with the purists and the
traditionalists a new school is springing up,&mdash;native yet
not necessarily national in a narrow sense; a genuine national
personality is being forged, whence will come the
literature of the future.</p>

<p>As to the position of the writer in Brazil and Spanish
America, it is still a very precarious one, not alone from
the economic viewpoint but from the climatological. “Intellectual
labour in Brazil,” wrote Romero, “is torture.
Wherefore we produce little; we quickly weary, age and
soon die.… The nation needs a dietetic regimen … more
than a sound political one. The Brazilian is
an ill-balanced being, impaired at the very root of existence;
made rather to complain than to invent, contemplative
rather than thoughtful; more lyrical and fond
of dreams and resounding rhetoric than of scientific,
demonstrable facts.” Such a short-lived, handicapped
populace has everything to do with literature, says this
historian. “It explains the precocity of our talents, their
speedy exhaustion, our facility in learning and the superficiality
of our inventive faculties.”</p>

<p>Should the writer conquer these difficulties, others await
him. The reading public, especially in earlier days, was
always small. “They say that Brazil has a population
of about 13,000,000,” comments a character in one of
Coelho Netto’s numerous novels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> “Of that number
12,800,000 can’t read. Of the remaining 200,000,
150,000 read only newspapers, 50,000 read French books,
30,000 read translations. Fifteen thousand others read
the catechism and pious books, 2,000 study Auguste
Comte, and 1,000 purchase Brazilian works.” And the
foreigners? To which the speaker replies, “They don’t
read us. This is a lost country.” Allowing for original
overstatement, the figures do not, of course, hold for
today, when the population is more than twice the number
in the quotation, when Netto himself goes into edition
after edition and, together with a few of his favoured
confrères, has been translated into French and English
and other languages. But they illustrate a fundamental
truth. Literature in Brazil has been, literally, a triumph
of mind over matter. Taken as a whole it is thus, at
this stage, not so much an esthetic as an autonomic affirmation.
Just as the nation, ethnologically, represents
the fusion of three races, with the whites at the head,
so, intellectually, does it represent a fusion of Portuguese
tradition, native spontaneity and modern European culture,
with France still predominant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We may recapitulate the preceding chapter in the following
paragraph:</p>

<p>Brazilian literature derives chiefly from the Portuguese
race, language and tradition as modified by the blending
of the colonizers with the native Indians and the imported
African slaves. At first an imitative prolongation of the
Portuguese heritage, it gradually acquires an autonomous
character, entering later into the universal currents of
literature as represented by European and particularly
French culture. French ascendency is definitely established
in 1830, and even well into the twentieth century
most English, German, Russian and Scandinavian works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
come in through the medium of French criticism and assimilation.<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>No two literary historians of Brazil agree upon a plan
of presentation. Fernandez Pinheiro (1872) and De
Carvalho (1919) reduce the phases to a minimum of
three; the first, somewhat too neatly, divides them into
that of the Formative Period (XVIth through XVIIth
century), the Period of Development (XVIIIth century),
the Period of Reform (XIXth century); the talented
De Carvalho accepts Romero’s first period, from
1500 to 1750, calling it that of Portuguese dominance,
inserts a Transition period from 1750 to the date of the
triumph of French Romanticism in 1830, and labels the
subsequent phase the Autonomous epoch. This is better
than Wolf’s five divisions (1863) and the no less than
sixteen suggested by the restless Romero in the résumé
that he wrote in 1900 for the <i>Livro do Centenario</i>. I
am inclined, on the whole, to favour the division suggested
by Romero in his <i>Historia da Literatura Brasileira</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
(1902).<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<table class="small" summary="Literary periods">
  <tr>
    <td>Period of Formation:</td><td>1500-1750</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Autonomous Development:</td><td>1750-1830</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Romantic Transformation:</td><td>1830-1870</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Critical, Naturalist Reaction, followed by Parnassians, Symbolists, etc.:</td><td>1870-</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The fourth division allows for the decidedly eclectic tendencies
subsequent upon the decline of Romanticism.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the four chapters that follow will deal
succinctly with these successive phrases of the nation’s literature.
Not so much separate works or men as the suffusing
spirit will engage our attention; what we are here
interested in is the formation and development of the
Brazilian imaginative creative personality and its salient
products.<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

fashion to the Brazilian habit of overstating the case of the
native imagination. There is no audacious flight, he declares; no soaring
of eagles and condors. “Whether we examine the popular literature
or the cultured, we find overwhelming proof of this assertion.
Our popular novels and anonymous songs are scant in plot, ingenious
imaginings, marvelous imagery, which are so common in their Slavic,
Celtic, Greek and Germanic congeners. And the contribution brought
by the negroes and indigenous tribes are even poorer than the part
that came to us from the Portuguese. Cultivated literature … is even
inferior to the popular productions from the standpoint of the imagination.…
Our imagination, which is of simply decorative type, is the
imagination of lyric spirits, of the sweet, monodic poetry of new souls
and young peoples.”</p>

has some interesting remarks upon the early hispanization of Portuguese
in Brazil. Among such effects of Spanish upon Brazilian Portuguese he
notes the transposition of the possessive pronouns; the opening of all
vowels, thus avoiding the elision of final <i>e</i> or converting final <i>o</i> into <i>u</i>;
the pronunciation of <i>s</i> at the end of a syllable as <i>s</i> instead of as <i>sh</i>, which

and forms wherever he finds it. Therein is he like the eagle, who hovers
with free gaze over whole countries, and to whom it is of no consequence
whether the hare on which he pounces is running in Prussia or in
Saxony.… And then, what is meant by love of one’s country? What
is meant by patriotic deeds? If the poet has employed a life in battling
with pernicious prejudice, in setting aside narrow views, in enlightening
the minds, purifying the tastes, ennobling the feelings and thoughts of
his countrymen, what better could he have done? how could he have
acted more patriotically?”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It is a question whether the people as a mass have
really created the poetry and legends which long
have been grouped under the designation of folk
lore. Here, as in the more rarefied atmosphere of art,
it is the gifted individual who originates or formulates the
central theme, which is then passed about like a small
coin that changes hands frequently; the sharp edges are
blunted, the mint-mark is erased, but the coin remains
essentially as at first. So that one may agree only halfway
with Senhor De Carvalho,<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> when he writes that
“true poetry is born in the mouths of the people as the
plant from wild and virgin soil. The people is the great
creator, sincere and spontaneous, of national epics, the
inspirer of artists, stimulator of warriors, director of the
fatherland’s destinies.” The people furnishes rather
the background against which the epics are enacted, the
audience rather than the performers. Upon the lore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
verses of their choosing they stamp the distinguishing folk
impress; the creative inspiration here, as elsewhere, is
the labour of the salient individual.</p>

<p>The study of the Brazilian popular muse owes much
to the investigations of the tireless, ubiquitous Sylvio
Romero, whom later writers have largely drawn upon.<a name="FNanchor_2_28" id="FNanchor_2_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_28" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
There are no documents for the contributions of the
Africans and few for the Tupys, whom Romero did not
credit with possessing a real poetry, as they had not
reached the necessary grade of culture. The most
copious data are furnished, quite naturally, by the Portuguese.
Hybrid verses appear as an aural and visible
symbol of the race-mixture that began almost immediately;
there are thus stanzas composed of blended verses
of Portuguese and Tupy, of Portuguese and African.
Here, as example, is a Portuguese-African song transcribed
by Romero in Pernambuco:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the whole, that same melancholy which is the hallmark
of so much Brazilian writing, is discernible in the
popular refrain. The themes are the universal ones of
love and fate, with now and then a flash of humour and
earthy practicality.</p>

<p>Romero, with his excessive fondness for categories (a
vice which with unconscious humour he was the very first
to flagellate), suggested four chief types of popular
poetry, (1) the <i>romances</i> and <i>xacaras</i>, (2) the <i>reisados</i>
and <i>cheganças</i>, (3) the <i>oraçoes</i> and <i>parlendos</i>, (4)
<i>versos geraes</i> or <i>quandrinhas</i>. In the same way the folk
tales are referred to Portuguese, native and African origin,
with a more recent addition of <i>mestiço</i> (hybrid,
mestee) material. “The Brazilian Sheherezade,” writes
De Carvalho,<a name="FNanchor_4_30" id="FNanchor_4_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_30" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “is more thoughtful than opulent, she educates
rather than dazzles. In the savage legends Nature
dominates man, and, as in the fables of Æsop and La
Fontaine, it is the animals who are charged with revealing
life’s virtues and deficiencies through their ingenious
wiles.… To the native, as is gathered from his most
famous tales, skill was surely a better weapon than
strength.” Long ago, the enthusiastic Denis, the first to
accord to Brazilian letters a treatment independent of
those of Portugal,<a name="FNanchor_5_31" id="FNanchor_5_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_31" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> had commented on the blending of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the imaginative, ardent African, the chivalrous Portuguese,
and the dreamy native, and had observed that “the
<i>mameluco</i> is almost always the hero of the poetic tales
invented in the country.” For, underneath the crust of
this civilization flows a strong current of popular inspiration.
At times, as during the Romantic period, this becomes
almost dominant. “We all, of the most diverse
social classes,” avers De Carvalho, “are a reflection of
this great folk soul, fashioned at the same time of melancholy
and splendour, of timidity and common sense. Our
folk lore serves to show that the Brazilian people, despite
its moodiness and sentimentality, retains at bottom a
clear comprehension of life and a sound, admirable inner
energy that, at the first touch, bursts forth unexpected
and indomitable.” This is, perhaps, an example of that
very sentimentality of which this engaging critic has been
speaking, for the folk lore of most nations reveals precisely
these same qualities. For us, the essential point
is that Brazilian popular poetry and tale exhibit the characteristic
national hybridism; the exotic here feeds upon
the exotic.<a name="FNanchor_6_32" id="FNanchor_6_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_32" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The sixteenth century, so rich in culture and accomplishment
for the Portuguese, is almost barren of literature
in Brazil. A few chroniclers, the self-sacrificing
Father Anchieta, the poet Bento Teixeiro Pinto,&mdash;and the
list is fairly exhausted. These are no times for esthetic
leisure; an indifferent monarch occupies the throne in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Lisbon for the first quarter of the century, with eyes
turned to India; in the colony the entire unwieldy apparatus
of old-world civilization is to be set up, races are
to be exterminated or reconciled in fusion, mines lure with
the glitter of gold and diamonds; a nationality, however
gradually and unwittingly, is to be formed. For, though
the majority of Portuguese in Brazil, as was natural,
were spiritually inhabitants of their mother country,
already there had arisen among some a fondness for a
land of so many enchantments.</p>

<p>José de Anchieta (1530-1597) is now generally regarded
as the earliest of the Brazilian writers. He is,
to Romero, the pivot of his century’s letters. For more
than fifty years he was the instructor of the population;
for his beloved natives he wrote grammars, lexicons,
plays, hymns; a gifted polyglot, he employed Portuguese,
Spanish, Latin, Tupy; he penned the first <i>autos</i> and mysteries
produced in Brazil. His influence, on the whole,
however, was more practical than literary; he was not, in
the esthetic sense a writer, but rather an admirable Jesuit
who performed, amidst the greatest difficulties, a work
of elementary civilization. The homage paid to his
name during the commemoration of the tercentenary of
his death was not only a personal tribute but in part, too,
a rectification of the national attitude toward the Jesuit
company which he distinguished. It was the Jesuits who
early established schools in the nation (in 1543 they
opened at Bahia the first institution of “higher education”);
it was they who sought to protect the Indians
from the cruelty of the over-eager exploiters; Senhor
Oliveira Lima has even suggested that it was owing to
a grateful recollection of the services rendered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
country by the Jesuits that the separation between Church
and State, decreed by the Republic in 1890, was effected
in so dignified and peaceful a manner. Lima quotes
Ribeiro to the effect that the province of Brazil already
possessed three <i>colegios</i> in Anchieta’s time, and that the
Jesuits, by the second half of the sixteenth century had
already brought at least 100,000 natives under their
guidance.<a name="FNanchor_7_33" id="FNanchor_7_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_33" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Romero, “scientifist” critic that he was, considered
the Jesuit influence “not at all a happy one in the
intellectual and esthetic formation of the new nationality.”
Of one thing we may be quite certain, in any
event: Anchieta’s position as precursor is more secure
than his merits as a creative spirit. His chief works are
<i>Brasilica Societatis Historia et vita clarorum Patrum qui
in Brasilia vixerunt</i>, a Latin series of biographies of his
fellow-workers; <i>Arte da grammatica da lingoa mais
usada na costa do Brasil</i>, a philological study; his <i>Cartas</i>
(letters); and a number of <i>autos</i> and poems.</p>

<p>Next to Anchieta, Bento Teixeira Pinto, who flourished
in the second half of the sixteenth century, is
Brazil’s most ancient poet.<a name="FNanchor_8_34" id="FNanchor_8_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_34" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Much ink has been spilled
over the question as to whether he was the author of the
entertaining <i>Dialogo das Grandezas do Brazil</i> and the
scrupulous Varnhagen, who at first denied Bento Teixeira’s
authorship of that document, later reversed his
position. Similar doubt exists as to the real author of
the <i>Relação do Naufragio que passou Jorge de Albuquerque
Coelho, vindo do Brasil no anno de 1565</i>, a moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
prose account of a shipwreck in which figures the
noble personage of the title, but wherein the supposed
author nowhere appears.</p>

<p>To that same noble personage, governor of Pernambuco,
is dedicated the <i>Prosopopéa</i>, undoubtedly the work
of Bento Teixeira, and just as undoubtedly a pedestrian
performance in stilted hendecasyllabic verses, ninety-four
octaves in all, in due classic form. There is much imitation
of Camões, who, indeed, entered Brazilian literature
as a powerful influence through these prosaic lines
of Bento Teixeira. “His poem (i. e., the <i>Lusiads</i> of
<i>Camões</i>) is henceforth to make our epics, his poetic language
will provide the instrument of our poets and his
admirable lyrism will influence down to the very present,
our own in all that it has and preserves of sorrow, longing,
nostalgia and Camonean love melancholy.”<a name="FNanchor_9_35" id="FNanchor_9_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_35" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Prosopopéa</i> occurs a description of the <i>recife</i>
of Pernambuco which has been looked upon as one of the
first evidences of the Brazilian fondness for the native
scene. The passage is utterly uninspired; Neptune and
Argos rub shoulders with the <i>barbaros</i> amid an insipid
succession of verses. Verissimo sees, in the entire poem,
no “shadow of the influence of the new milieu in which
it was conceived and executed.” The earliest genuine
manifestation of such nativism in poetry he does not discover
until <i>A Ilha da Maré</i>, by Manoel Botelho de Oliveira,
which, though published in the eighteenth century
was, most likely, written in the seventeenth.<a name="FNanchor_10_36" id="FNanchor_10_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_36" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The chroniclers of the early colonial period present
chiefly points of historic, rather than literary, interest.
Pero de Magalhães Gandavo, with his <i>Historia da Provincia
de Santa Cruz a que vulgarmente chamamos Brasil</i>
(with a verse-letter by Luiz de Camões as preface), published
in 1576 in Lisbon, is regarded as the first in the
long line of historians; even today he is valuable as a
source. Gabriel Soares de Souza, is far better known for
his <i>Tractado descriptivo do Brasil em 1587</i>, printed in
1851 by Varnhagen and highly praised by that voluminous
investigator for its “profound observation.” …
“Neither Dioscorides nor Pliny better explains the plants
of the old world than Soares those of the new.… It is
astonishing how the attention of a single person could occupy
itself with so many things … such as are contained
in his work, which treats at the same time, in relation
to Brazil, of geography, history, typography,
hydrography, intertropical agriculture, Brazilian horticulture,
native materia medica, wood for building and for
cabinet-work, zoology in all its branches, administrative
economy and even mineralogy!”</p>

<p>Of less importance is the Jesuit Father Fernão Cardim
(1540-1625), whose work was made known in 1847
by Varnhagen under the geographic title <i>Narrativa epistolar
de uma viagem e missão jesuitica pela Bahia, Ilheos,
Porto Seguro, Pernambuco, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro,
etc.</i> It consists of two letters, dated 1583 and
addressed to the provincial of the Company in Portugal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Father Cardim was translated into English as early as
1625, being thus represented by the manuscript called <i>Do
Principo e origem dos indios do Brasil e de seus costumes,
adoração e ceremonias</i>, if this is, as Capistrano
de Abreu has tried to prove, really the work taken in
1601 by Francis Cook from a Jesuit bound for Brazil.
For, “it was exactly in this year … that Father Fernão
Cardim, who was returning to Brazil from a voyage
to Rome, was taken prisoner by English corsairs and
brought to England.”</p>

<p>There is little profit in listing the men and works of
this age and character. According to Romero the chroniclers
exhibit thus early the duplex tendency of Brazilian
literature,&mdash;description of nature and description of the
savage. The tendency grows during the seventeenth
century and in the eighteenth becomes predominant, so
that viewed in this light, Brazilian nativism, far from
being the creation of nineteenth century Romanticism, was
rather a historic prolongation.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The sporadic evidences of a nascent nativism become
in the seventeenth century a conscious affirmation. The
struggle against the Dutch in Pernambuco and the
French in Maranhão compelled a union of the colonial
forces and instilled a sort of Brazilian awareness. The
economic situation becomes more firm, so that Romero
may regard the entire century as the epoch of sugar, even
as the succeeding century was to be one of gold, and the
nineteenth,&mdash;as indeed the twentieth,&mdash;one of coffee.
Agriculture even before the mines,&mdash;as Lima has pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
out,&mdash;was creating the fortune of the land.<a name="FNanchor_11_37" id="FNanchor_11_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_37" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> “The new
society of the prosperous American colony is no longer
essentially Portuguese; the mill-owners, well off and intelligent,
forming a sort of rural aristocracy, similar to that
of the feudal barons, are its best-read and most enlightened
representatives. Around this tiny but powerful
nucleus revolve all the political and economic affairs of
the young nationality. Two profoundly serious factors
also appear: the Brazilian family, perfectly constituted,
and a hatred for the foreigner, nourished chiefly by religious
fanaticism. The Lutheran, English or Flemish,
was the common enemy … against whom all vengeance
was sacred, all crime just and blessed.”<a name="FNanchor_12_38" id="FNanchor_12_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_38" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In Brazilian literature, the century belongs mainly to
Bahia, which during the second half became a court in
little, with its governor as the center of a luxurious entourage.
Spanish influence, as represented in the all-conquering
Góngora, vied with that of the poets of the
Italian and Portuguese renaissance; Tasso, Lope de
Vega, Gabriel de Castro and a host of others were much
read and imitated. And in the background rose a rude
civilization reared upon slavery and greed, providing rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
material for the satirical shafts of Gregorio de Mattos
Guerra, well-named by his contemporaries the “hell-mouth”
of Bahia. In Antonio Vieira and Gregorio
Mattos, Romero discovers the two antagonistic forces of
the epoch: Vieira, the symbol of “Portuguese arrogance
in action and vacuity in ideas”; Gregorio Mattos,
the most perfect incarnation of the Brazilian spirit, “facetious,
informal, ironic, sceptical, a precursor of the <i>Bohemios</i>.”
As we shall presently note, opinion upon the
“hell-mouth’s” Brazilianism is not unanimous.</p>

<p>The salient chroniclers and preachers of the century
may be passed over in rapid review. At their head
easily stands Frei Vicente do Salvador, (1564-1636/39)
author of the <i>Historia da Custodia do Brasil</i>, which was
not published until 1888, more than two hundred and
sixty years after it was written (1627). His editor,
Capistrano de Abreu, has pointed out his importance as
a reagent against the dominant tendency of spiritual servitude
to Portugal. “To him Brazil means more than a
geographical expression; it is a historical and social term.
The XVIIth century is the germination of this idea, as
the XVIIIth is its ripening.” The <i>Historia</i> possesses,
furthermore, a distinct importance for the study of folk
lore. Manoel de Moraes (1586-1651) enjoys what
might be called a cenotaphic renown as the author of a
<i>Historia da America</i> that has never been found. Little
more than names are Diogo Gomes Carneiro and Frei
Christovão da Madre de Deus Luz.</p>

<p>Of far sterner stuff than his vagrant brother Gregorio
was the preacher Eusebio de Mattos (1629-1692) who
late in life left the Company of Jesus. There is little in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his sermons to fascinate the modern mind or rejoice the
soul, and one had rather err in the company of his bohemian
brother. As Eusebio was dubbed, in the fashion
of the day, a second Orpheus for his playing upon the
harp and the viola, so Antonio de Sá (1620-1678) became
the “Portuguese Chrysostom.” Yet little gold
flowed in his speech, which fairly out-Góngora-ed Góngora
himself. “His culture, like that of almost all the
Jesuits was false; rhetorical rather than scientific, swollen
rather than substantial.”<a name="FNanchor_13_39" id="FNanchor_13_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_39" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The poets of the century narrow down to two, of
whom the first may be dismissed with scant ceremony.
Manoel Botelho de Oliveira (1636-1711) was the first
Brazilian poet to publish a book of verses. His <i>Musica
do Parnaso em quatro coros de rimas portuguezas, castelhanas,
italianas e latinas, com seu descante comico reduzido
em duas comedias</i> was published at Lisbon in 1705.
Yet for all this battery of tongues there is little in the
book to commend it, and it would in all likelihood be all
but forgotten by today were it not for the descriptive
poem <i>A Ilha da Maré</i>, in which has been discovered,&mdash;as
we have seen in our citation from Verissimo,&mdash;one of the
earliest manifestations of nativism; Botelho de Oliveira’s
Brazilianism, as appears from his preface, was a conscious
attitude, and the patient, plodding cataloguing of
the national fruit-garden precedes by a century the seventh
canto of the epic <i>Caramurú</i>; but for all this, there are in
the three hundred and twenty-odd lines of the poem only
some four verses with any claim to poetic illumination.
The depths of bathetic prose are reached in a passage oft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
quoted by Brazilian writers; it reads like a seed catalogue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Tenho explicado as fruitas e os legumes,</div>
<div class="verse">Que dão a Portugal muitos ciumes;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Tenho recopilado</div>
<div class="verse">O que o Brasil contém para invejado,</div>
<div class="verse">E para preferir a toda terra,</div>
<div class="verse">Em si perfeitos quatro AA encerra.</div>
<div class="verse">Tem o primeiro A, nos arvoredos</div>
<div class="verse">Sempre verdes aos olhos, sempre ledos;</div>
<div class="verse">Tem o segunda A nos ares puros,</div>
<div class="verse">Na temperie agradaveis e seguros;</div>
<div class="verse">Tem o terceiro A, nas aguas frias</div>
<div class="verse">Que refrescam o peito e são sadias,</div>
<div class="verse">O quarto A, no assucar deleitoso,</div>
<div class="verse">Que é do mundo o regalo mais mimoso;</div>
<div class="verse">São, pois, os quatro AA por singuares</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Arvoredos</i>, <i>assucar</i>, <i>aguas</i>, <i>ares</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_40" id="FNanchor_14_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_40" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All of which bears almost the same relation to poetry
as the grouping of the three B’s (Bach, Beethoven and
Brahms) to musical criticism. Romero found the poet’s
nationalism an external affair; “the pen wished to depict
Brazil, but the soul belonged to Spanish or Portuguese
cultism.” So, too, Carvalho, who would assign
the genuine beginnings of Brazilian sentiment to Gregorio
de Mattos.</p>

<p>Gregorio de Mattos Guerra (1633-1696) is easily the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
outstanding figure of his day. Romero, who considered
him the pivot of seventeenth-century letters in Brazil,
would claim for him, too, the title of creator of that literature,
because he was&mdash;though educated, like most of
the cultured men of his day, at Coimbra&mdash;a son of the
soil, more nationally minded than Anchieta and in perfect
harmony with his milieu. He reveals a Brazilian manner
of handling the language; indeed, he “is the document
in which we can appreciate the earliest modifications
undergone by the Portuguese language in America.…”
He reveals a consciousness of being something
new and distinct from Europe’s consideration of the new-world
inhabitants as a species of <i>anima vilis</i>. He represents
the tendency of the various races to poke fun at
one another. More important still, he betrays a nascent
discontent with the mother country’s rule. He is
“the genuine imitator of our lyric poetry and of our
lyric intuition. His <i>brasileiro</i> was not the caboclo nor
the Negro nor the Portuguese; he was already the son of
the soil, able to ridicule the separatist pretensions of the
three races.” Thus far Romero. Verissimo however&mdash;and
the case may well be taken as an instance of the unsettled
conditions prevailing in Brazilian literary criticism&mdash;takes
a view antipodally apart. “The first generation
of Brazilian poets, Gregorio de Mattos included,
is exclusively Portuguese. To suppose that there is in
Gregorio de Mattos any originality of form or content
is to show one’s ignorance of the Portuguese poetry of
his time, and of the Spanish, which was so close to it and
which the Portuguese so much imitated, and which he, in
particular, fairly plagiarized.”<a name="FNanchor_15_41" id="FNanchor_15_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_41" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Long ago, Ferdinand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Wolf, in the first history of Brazilian letters that made
any claims to completeness,<a name="FNanchor_16_42" id="FNanchor_16_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_42" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> noted the poet’s heavy indebtedness
to Lope de Vega and Góngora, and his servile
imitation of Quevedo.</p>

<p>Verissimo, I believe, overstates his case. That Gregorio
de Mattos was not an original creative spirit may
at once be admitted. But he was an undoubted personality;
he aimed his satiric shafts only too well at prominent
creatures of flesh and blood and vindictive passions;
he paid for his ardour and temerity with harsh exile
and in the end would seem even to have evinced a sincere
repentance. The motto of his life’s labours, indeed,
might be a line from one of his most impertinent poems:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Eu, que me não sei calar” …</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I, who cannot hold my tongue …</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nor did Gregorio de Mattos hold his tongue, whether
in the student days at Coimbra&mdash;where already he was
feared for that wagging lance&mdash;or during his later vicissitudes
in Brazil. In 1864 he married Maria dos Povos,
whose reward for advising him to give up his satiric
habits was to be made the butt of his next satire. It
would have been a miracle if he were either happy with
or faithful to her; he was neither. He slashed right
and left about him; argued cases&mdash;and won them!&mdash;in
rhyme; poverty, however, was his constant companion,
so that, for other reasons aplenty, his wife soon left
him. Now his venom bursts forth all the less restrained.
Personal enmities made among the influential were bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
soon or late to recoil upon him and toward the end of
his life he was exiled to the African colony of Angola.
Upon his return to Brazil he was prohibited from writing
verses and sought solace in his viola, in which he was
skilled.</p>

<p>Gregorio de Mattos’s satire sought familiar targets:
the judge, the client, the abusive potentate, the venal
religious. “Perhaps without any intention on his part,”
suggests Carvalho, “he was our first newspaper, wherein
are registered the petty and great scandals of the epoch,
the thefts, crimes, adulteries, and even the processions,
anniversaries and births that he so gaily celebrated in his
verses.”<a name="FNanchor_17_43" id="FNanchor_17_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_43" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> His own countrymen he likened to stupid
beasts of burden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Que os Brasileiros são bestas,</div>
<div class="verse">E estão sempre a trabalhar</div>
<div class="verse">Toda a vida por manter</div>
<div class="verse">Maganos de Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_18_44" id="FNanchor_18_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_44" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a tenderer aspect to the poet, early noted in
his sonnets; despite the wild life he led there are accents
of sincerity in his poems of penitence; no less sincere, if
less lofty, are his poems of passion, in which love is faunesque,
sensual, a thing of hot lips and anacreontic abandon.
He can turn a pretty (and empty) compliment
almost as gracefully as his Spanish models. But it is
really too much to institute a serious comparison between
him and Verlaine, as Carvalho would do. Some outward
resemblance there is in the lives of the men (yet how common
after all, are repentance after ribaldry, and connubial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
infelicity), but Carvalho destroys his own case in the very
next paragraph. For, as he indicates, the early Brazilian’s
labours “represent in the history of our letters, it is
needful to repeat, the revolt of bourgeois common sense
against the ridiculousness of the Portuguese nobility.”
How far from all this was the nineteenth century Frenchman,
with a sensitive soul delicately attuned to life’s finer
harmonies!</p>

<p>I am surprised that no Brazilian has found for Gregorio
de Mattos Guerra a parallel spirit much nearer than
Verlaine in both time and space. The Peruvian Caviedes
was some twenty years younger than his Brazilian
contemporary; his life has been likened to a picaresque
novel. He was no closet-spirit and his addiction to the
flesh, no whit less ardent than Gregorio’s, resulted in
the unmentionable affliction. He, too, repented, before
marriage rather than after; his wife dying, he surrendered
to drink and died four years before the Brazilian, if 1692
is the correct date. As Gregorio de Mattos flayed the
luxury of Bahia, so Caviedes guffawed at the sybarites
of Lima.<a name="FNanchor_19_45" id="FNanchor_19_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_45" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>He castigated monastic corruption, trounced the
physicians, manhandled the priests, and his snickers
echoed in the high places. He knew his Quevedo quite
as well as did Gregorio and has been called “the first
revolutionary, the most illustrious of colonial poets.”<a name="FNanchor_20_46" id="FNanchor_20_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_46" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
And toward his end he makes his peace with the Lord in
a sonnet that might have been signed by Gregorio.</p>

<p>Of Gregorio de Mattos I will quote a single sonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
written in one of his more sober moods. There is a
pleasant, if somewhat conventional, epigrammatical
quality to it, as to more than one of the others, and there
is little reason for questioning its sincerity. Every
satirist, at bottom, contains an elegiac poet,&mdash;the ashes
that remain after the fireworks have exploded. If here,
as elsewhere, only the feeling belongs to the poet, since
both form and content are of the old world whence he
drew so many of his topics and so much of his inspiration,
there is an undoubted grafting of his salient personality
upon the imported plant.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The first half of the eighteenth century, a review of
which brings our first period to a close, is the era of the
<i>bandeirantes</i> in Brazilian history and of the Academies
in the national literature. The external enemies had
been fought off the outer boundaries in the preceding
century; now had come the time for the conquest of the
interior.<a name="FNanchor_22_48" id="FNanchor_22_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_48" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The <i>bandeirantes</i> were so called from
<i>bandeira</i>, signifying a band; the earliest expeditions
into the hinterland were called <i>entradas</i>, and it is only
when the exploring caravans grew more numerous and
organized that the historic name <i>bandeirantes</i> was bestowed.
Men and women of all ages, together with the
necessary animals, composed these moving outposts of
conquest. This was a living epic; the difficulties were all
but insurmountable and the heroism truly superhuman.
No literature this,&mdash;with its law of the jungle which is no
law,&mdash;with its immitigable cruelty to resisting indigenous
tribes, and finally, the internecine strife born of partial
failure, envy and vindictiveness.</p>

<p>While the <i>bandeirantes</i> were carrying on the tradition
of Portuguese bravery&mdash;evidence of a restlessness which
Carvalho would find mirrored even today in the “intellectual
nomadism” of his countrymen, as well as in their
political and cultural instability&mdash;the literary folk of the
civilized centers were following the tradition of Portuguese
imitation. At Bahia and Rio de Janeiro Academies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
were formed, evidencing some sort of attempt at unifying
taste and aping, at a distance, the favourite diversion that
the Renaissance had itself copied from the academies
of antiquity. The first of these, founded in 1724 by the
Viceroy Vasco Fernandez Cezar de Menezes, was christened
<i>Academia Brazilica dos Esqueçidos</i>,&mdash;that is, the
Brazilian Academy of those Forgotten or Overlooked
by the <i>Academia de Historia</i> established, 1720, at Lisbon.
A sort of “spite” academy, then, this first Brazilian
body, but constituting at the same time, in a way, a
new-world affirmation. Among the other academies
were that of the <i>Felizes</i> 1736 (i. e., happy), the <i>Selectos</i>,
1752, and the <i>Renascidos</i>, 1759, (reborn) none of which
continued for long. Although the influence of Góngora
was receding, Rocha Pitta’s <i>Historia da America Portugueza</i>
is replete with pompous passages, exaggerated
estimates and national “boostings” that read betimes
like the gorgeous pamphlets issued by a tourist company.
Pride in the national literature is already evident. The
itch to write epics is rife; it bites João de Brito Lima,
who indites a work (<i>Cezaria</i>) in 1300 octaves
praising the Viceroy. Gonzalo Soares de França
exceeds this record in his <i>Brazilia</i>, adding 500 octaves to
the score. Manoel de Santa Maria Itaparica composes
a sacred epic, <i>Eustachidos</i>, on the life of St. Eustace, in
six cantos, each preceded by an octave summary; the
fifth canto contains a quasiprophetic vision in which
posterity, in the guise of an old man, requests the author
to celebrate his native isle. This section, the <i>Ilha da
Itaparica</i>, has rescued the poem from total oblivion.
But the passage possesses hardly any transmissive fervor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and the native scene is viewed through the glasses of
Greek mythology.</p>

<p>Some wrote in Latin altogether upon Brazilian topics,
as witness Prudencio do Amaral’s poem on sugar-manufacture
(no less!) entitled <i>De opifichio sacchario</i>; the
cultivation of manioc and tobacco were equally represented
in these pseudo-Virgilian efforts.</p>

<p>It is a barren half century for literature. Outside of
the author of the <i>Eustachidos</i> and the two important
figures to which we soon come only the brothers
Bartholomeu Lourenço and Alexandre de Gusmão are
remembered, and they do not come properly within the
range of literary history. The one was a physicist and
mathematician; the other, a statesman. The latter in
his <i>Marido Confundido</i>, 1737, wrote a comedy in reply
to Molière’s <i>Georges Dandin</i>, much to the delight of the
Lisbonese audiences.</p>

<p>The two salient figures of the epoch are Sebastião da
Rocha Pitta (1660-1738) and Antonio José da Silva
(1705-1739).</p>

<p>Brazilian critics seem well disposed to forget Rocha
Pitta’s mediocre novels and sterile verses; it is for his
<i>Historia</i> that he is remembered, and fondly, despite all
the extravagances of style that mark the book. Romero
regards it as a patriotic hymn, laden with ostentatious
learning and undoubted leanings toward Portugal.
Oliveira Lima’s view, however, is more scientific and
historically dispassionate. One could not well expect of
a writer at the beginning of the eighteenth century a
nationalistic sentiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> “which in reality was still of
necessity embryonic, hazy, or at least, ill-defined.… In
our historian, none the less, there reigns a sympathy for
all that is of his land.”<a name="FNanchor_23_49" id="FNanchor_23_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_49" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> And, indeed, the <i>Historia</i>, as
Romero wrote, is more a poem than a chronological
narrative, cluttered with saints and warriors, prophets,
heroes of antiquity and mediaeval days.</p>

<p>“In no other region,” runs one of the passages best
known to Brazilians, “is the sky more serene, nor does
dawn glow more beautifully; in no other hemisphere does
the sun flaunt such golden rays nor such brilliant nocturnal
glints; the stars are more benign and ever joyful;
the horizons where the sun is born or where it sinks to
rest are always unclouded; the water, whether it be drunk
from the springs in the fields or from the town aqueduct,
is of the purest; Brazil, in short, is the Terrestrial Paradise
discovered at last, wherein the vastest rivers arise
and take their course.”</p>

<p>I am inclined to question whether Antonio José da
Silva really belongs to the literature of Brazil. Romero
would make out a case for him on the ground of birth in
the colony, family influences and the nature of his lyrism,
which, according to that polemical spirit, was Brazilian.
Yet his plays are linked with the history of the Portuguese
drama and it is hard to discover, except by excessive
reading between the lines, any distinctive Brazilian
character. Known to his contemporaries by the sobriquet
<i>O Judeu</i> (The Jew), Antonio José early experienced
the martyrdom of his religion at the hands of the Inquisition.
At the age of eight he was taken to Portugal by
his mother, who was summoned thither to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the charge of Judaism; in 1726 he was compelled to answer
to the same charge, but freed; hostile forces were
at work against him, however, not alone for his religious
beliefs but for his biting satire, and chiefly through the
bought depositions of a servant he was finally convicted
and burned on October 21st, 1739. The strains of one
of his operettas fairly mingled with the crackling of the
flames. This fate made of him a national figure in Brazil;
the first tragedy written by a Brazilian makes of him
the protagonist (<i>O Poeta e a Inquisição</i>, 1839, by
Magalhães); the second of Joaquim Norberto de Sousa’s
<i>Cantos Epicos</i> is dedicated to him (1861). Still another
literature claims Antonio José, who occupies an honoured
place in the annals of the Jewish drama.<a name="FNanchor_24_50" id="FNanchor_24_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_50" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> And it is not
at all impossible that the melancholy which Romero discovers
amidst the Jew’s gay compositions is as much a
heritage of his race as of the Brazilian <i>modinhas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_51" id="FNanchor_25_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_51" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Already
Wolf had found in Antonio José’s musical farces
a likeness to the opera bouffe of Offenbach, a fellow Jew;
the Jew takes naturally to music and to satire, so that
his prominence in the history of comic opera may be no
mere coincidence. Satire and melancholy, twin sisters
with something less than the usual resemblance, inhere in
the race of Antonio José.</p>

<p>Antonio José da Silva had in him much of the rollicking,
roistering, ribald, rhyming rogue. For long, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>he
was the most popular of the Portuguese dramatists
after Gil Vicente. He studied Rotrou, Molière and the
libretti of Metastasio to good advantage, and for his
musical ideas went to school to the Italians. Sr. Ribeiro
has repudiated any connection between these conventionalized
airs&mdash;the form of the verses is just as conventional&mdash;and
the distinctive Brazilian <i>modinha</i>; the
truth is that Romero, eager to make as good an appearance
for the national literature as possible, and realizing
that the eighteenth century in Brazil needed all the help
it could receive, made an unsuccessful attempt to dragoon
Antonio José into the thin ranks.<a name="FNanchor_26_52" id="FNanchor_26_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_52" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> As it is, his reputation
in Portugal has suffered a decline, merging into the
obscurity of the very foibles it sought to castigate. The
martyred Jew has had no creative influence upon Brazilian
literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first phase of Brazilian letters is, then, a tentative
groping, reflecting the numerous influences across the
ocean and the instability of a nascent civilization at war
on the one hand with covetous foreigners and on the
other with fractious, indigenous tribes. The chroniclers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
are in the main picturesque, informative, rambling rather
than artistic; the poets are either vacuous or swollen with
the pomp of old-world rhetoric. Even so virile a spirit
as Gregorio de Mattos conducts his native satire with
the stylistic weapons forged in Europe, and the dawn of
a valid nativism is shot through with gleams of spiritual
adherence to Portugal and intellectual subjection to the
old continent. Yet, as the child is father to the man, so
even in these faltering voices may be detected the dominant
notes of the later literature,&mdash;its imagination, its
fondness for rotund expression, its pride of milieu, its
Oriental exuberance, its wistful moodiness, its sensual
ardor.</p>

Brazil’s lack of a national poet during the sixteenth century. “Brazil
did not possess, during the XVIth century a national poet who could express,
with all the sincerity of his soul, the passion of the struggle undertaken
by culture against nature.… And this absence of a representative
poet is evidenced throughout our literature, since, after all, the
Indianism of the XIXth century was only a poetic convention grafted
upon the trunk of the political break with the Portuguese fatherland.…
The fact is that the exploits of yesterday still await the singer
who shall chant them. The Indians were idealized by a Romanticism
in quest of elevated souls; the Africans found defenders who rose in
audacious flight, but the brave pioneers of the conquest, men of epic
stature, have not received even the same measure of sympathy.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Struggle for the territory of Brazil had bred
a love for the soil that was bound sooner or
later to become spiritualized into an aspiration
toward autonomy. The <i>brasileiros</i> were not forever to
remain the <i>bestas</i> that the hell-mouth of Bahia had called
them, nor provide luxury for the <i>maganos de Portugal</i>.
The history of colonial exploitation repeated itself: Spain
with Spanish-America, Portugal with Brazil, England
with the future United States. Taxes grew, and with
them, resentment. Yet, as so often, the articulation of
that rebellious spirit came not from the chief sufferers of
oppression, but from an idealistic band of poets whose
exact motives have not yet been thoroughly clarified by
historical investigation. Few less fitted to head a separatist
movement than these lyric, idealistic spirits who
form part of the <i>Inconfidencia</i> (Disloyalty) group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
immortalized in Brazilian history through the hanging of
<i>Tiradentes</i> and the imprisonment and exile of a number
of others. These men were premature in their attempt,
and foredoomed to failure, but they lived, as well as
wrote, an ideal and thus form at once an epoch in the
national history and the nation’s letters. The freedom
won by the United States, the foreshadowing of the
French revolution, inspired in them ideas of a Brazilian
republic; how surely idealistic was such an aim may be
realized when we recall that Brazil’s emancipation was
initiated with a monarchy (1822) and that, although it
has been a republic since 1889, there are a number of
serious thinkers who consider the more liberal form of
government still less a boon than a disadvantage.</p>

<p>In 1783, Luis da Cunha de Menezes, a vain, pompous
fellow, was named Captain-General of the Province of
Minas. It was against him that were launched the nine
satirical verse letters called <i>Cartas Chilenas</i> and signed
by the pseudonym <i>Critillo</i> (1786). Menezes was succeeded
by Barbacena (1788) who it was rumoured,
meant to exact the payment of 700 <i>arrobas</i> of gold, overdue
from the province. It was this that proved the immediate
stimulus to an only half-proved case of revolt,
which, harshly suppressed, deprived Brazil of a number
of its ripest talents.</p>

<p>From the name of the province&mdash;Minas Geraes&mdash;these
poets have been grouped into a so-called Mineira
school, which includes the two epicists, Frei José de Santa
Rita Durão and José Basilio de Gama, and the four
lyrists, Claudio Manoel da Costa, Thomas Antonio Gonzaga,
Ignacio José de Alvarenga Peixoto and Manoel
Ignacio da Silva Alvarenga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Critics are not agreed upon the relative non-esthetic
values of Basilio da Gama’s <i>Uraguay</i> (1769)<a name="FNanchor_1_53" id="FNanchor_1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_53" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Santa
Rita Durão’s <i>Caramurú</i> (1781). Wolf, with Almeida-Garrett,
finds the first a truly national poem; Carvalho
calls it “the best and most perfect poem that appeared in
Brazil throughout the colonial period”; the early Denis
found it not very original, for all its stylistic amenities;
Romero, conceding its superiority to <i>Caramurú</i> in style
and form, finds it inferior in historical understanding,
terming the latter epic “the most Brazilian poem we
possess.” Verissimo, who has written an extended comparison
of the two poems,<a name="FNanchor_2_54" id="FNanchor_2_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_54" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is, to me, at least, most satisfying
of all upon the problems involved and the esthetic
considerations implied. In both the epics he discerns
the all-pervading influence of Camões, the emulation of
whom has seemed to cast upon every succeeding poet
the obligation of writing his epic. Thus the chief initiators
of Brazilian Romanticism, Porto Alegre and Magalhães,
had to indite, respectively, a <i>Colombo</i> and a <i>Confederação
dos Tamoyos</i>, and Gonçalves Dias began <i>Os
Tymbiras</i>, while José de Alencar, romantic of the Romantics,
started a <i>Filhos de Tupan</i>, “which happily for our
good and his own, he never completed.” But what renders
both the <i>Uruguay</i> and the <i>Caramurú</i> important in
the national literature is the fact that they stand out from
the ruck of earlier and later Camonean imitations by
virtue of a certain spontaneity of origin and an intuitive,
historic relation with their day. It is not known whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the authors, though contemporaries, knew each other or
read their respective works. Yet both instinctively employed
indigenous material and revealed that same “national
sentiment which was already stammering, though
timorously, in certain poets contemporaneous with them
or immediately preceding, such as Alvarenga Peixoto and
Silva Alvarenga, with whom there enter into our poetry,
mingled with classical images and comparison, names and
things of our own. Though like Basilio and Durão,
loyal Portuguese, these poets speak already of fatherland
with exaltation and love. The idea of the fatherland, the
national thought, which in Gregorio de Mattos is as yet a
simple movement of bad humour, vagrant spite and
the revolt of an undisciplined fellow, becomes in them the
tender affection for their native land.…”</p>

<p>The <i>Uruguay</i> especially reveals this nascent nationalism
as it existed among the loyal Portuguese in the epoch
just previous to the <i>Inconfidencia</i>. “We must remember
that the work of the Mineira poets” (and here Verissimo
includes, of course, the lyrists to which we presently
come) “abound in impressions of loyalty to Portugal.…
Let us not forget José Bonifacio, the so-called
patriarch of our Independence, served Portugal devotedly
first as scientist in official intellectual commissions
and professor at the University of Coimbra, and then as
volunteer Major of the Academic Corps against the
French of Napoleon, and finally as Intendente Geral, or
as we should say today, Chief of Police, of the city of
Porto. And José Bonifacio, like Washington, was at
first hostile, or at least averse, to independence.”</p>

<p>The <i>Uruguay</i> is certainly less intense than the Caramurú
in its patriotism. The author of the first wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it, as he said, to satisfy a certain curiosity about Uruguay;
also, he might have added, to flatter his patron, the then
powerful Pombal, who, it will be recalled, at one time
harboured the idea of transplanting the Portuguese
throne to the colony across the sea. It would be an error,
however, to see in the small epic (but five cantos
long) a glorification of the native. The real hero, as
Verissimo shows, is not Cacambo, but the Portuguese
General Gomes Freire de Andrade. The villains, of
course, are the Jesuits out of whose fold the author had
come,&mdash;the helpers of the Indians of Uruguay who revolted
against the treaty between Portugal and Spain
according to which they were given into the power of the
Portuguese. The action, for an epic, is thus restricted
in both time and space, let alone significance, yet thus
early the liberating genius of Basilio da Gama produced,
for Portuguese literature, “its first romantic poem.”
Here is the first&mdash;or surely one of the first&mdash;authentic
evidences of what the Spanish-American critics call
“literary Americanism,”&mdash;all the more interesting because
so largely unpremeditated.</p>

<p>The “romanticism” of the <i>Uruguay</i> is worth dwelling
upon, if only to help reveal our long-tolerated terminological
inadequacy.<a name="FNanchor_3_55" id="FNanchor_3_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_55" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It begins, not with the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
invocation, but with a quasi-Horatian plunge <i>in medias
res</i>. It does not employ the outworn octave, but sonorous
blank verse. The freedom of its style and the harmony
of its verse “announce Garrett, Gonçalves Dias<a name="FNanchor_4_56" id="FNanchor_4_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_56" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and the future admirable modellers of blank verse, in the
distribution of the episodes and the novelty of language
and simile.” The language is not the Gongoristic extravagance
of the Academicians; it is modern, even contemporary,
grandiloquent in the Spanish style. The “Indianism”
of the poem, in which Basilio da Gama forecasts
the later Indianism of the Romantics, is not to be
confused with that later type; for it must be recalled
that Basilio da Gama did not look upon his Indians with
that sentimental veneration characteristic of the nineteenth
century Brazilians. As they were secondary to
his purpose, so were they in his conception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> “Two and
distinct are the features of this aspect of our literature.
The first Indianism, initiated by Basilio da Gama, continued
by Durão and almost limited to the two epics, is
hardly more than a poetic artifice; the Indian enters as
a necessity of the subject, a simple esthetic or rhetorical
means. He is not sung, but is rather an element of the
song. In the second Indianism, that of the Romantics,&mdash;the
loftiest representative of which is Gonçalves
Dias,&mdash;the Indian advances from the position of an accessory
to that of an essential element; he is the subject
and the object of the poem. In this first phase of Indianism
the sympathy of the poet is transferred only incidentally
to the savage.… The contrary case obtains in
the second phase; the sympathy of the poet is his entirely.
So that, in the main, it is the attitude of the poet that
distinguished the two Indianisms: indifferent in the first,
sympathetic in the second.” And since choices must be
made, Verissimo is right when he finds the earlier poets
nearer to the sociological truth in preferring Portuguese
civilization, with all its defects, to the imaginary charms
of indigenous life. Yet sociological error of the Romantic
Indianists proved more than poetic truth, for it was
fecund “not only for literature, but even for the development
of the national sentiment.” … “<i>O Uruguay</i>
possesses in Portuguese literature the value of being the
first poem of a freer, newer, more spontaneous character
after the series of epics derived from <i>Os Lusiadas</i>,
and in Brazilian literature that of being the initiator
of the movement which, whatever its aberrations,
contributed the most to the independence of our letters.…”</p>

<p>There is far less artistic pleasure in reading <i>O Caramurú</i>;
it may well be, as most agree, that it, rather than
<i>O Uruguay</i>, is the national poem, but such a distinction
pertains rather to patriotism than to poetry. The better
verses of the earlier epic are a balm to the ear and a
stimulus to the imagination; those of the later lack communicative
essence. Santa Rita Durão, proclaiming in
his preface the parity of Brazil with India as the subject
of an epic, thus places himself as a rival of Camões; instead,
he is an indifferent versifier and an unconscionable
imitator; his patriotism, as his purpose, is avowed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
subject of his epic is the half-legendary figure of Diogo
Alvares Correa,<a name="FNanchor_5_57" id="FNanchor_5_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_57" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a sort of Brazilian John Smith, who,
wrecked upon the coast, so impressed the natives with the
seeming magic of his firearms that he was received as
their chief. His particular Pocahontas was the maiden
Paraguassú, whom he is supposed to have taken with him
to France; here she was baptized&mdash;as the disproved story
goes&mdash;and at the marriage of the pair none less than
Henry II and Catherine de Medicis stood sponsor to
them.</p>

<p>Paragussú’s chief rival is Moema, and the one undisputed
passage of the poem is the section in which, together
with a group of other lovelorn maidens, she swims
after the vessel that is bearing him and his chosen bride
off to France. In her dying voice she upbraids him and
then sinks beneath the waves.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Perde o lume dos olhos, pasma e treme,</div>
<div class="verse">Pallida a côr, o aspecto moribundo,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Yet there is a single line in <i>O Uruguay</i> which contains
more poetry than this octave and many another of the
stanzas in this ten-canto epic. It is that in which is described
the end of Cacambo’s sweetheart Lindoya, after
she has drunk the fatal potion that reveals to her the destruction
of Lisbon and the expulsion of the Jesuits by
Pombal, and then commits suicide by letting a serpent
bite her.</p>

<p>Like <i>O Uruguay</i>, so <i>O Caramurú</i> ends upon a note of
spiritual allegiance to Portugal. It is worth while recalling,
too, that the Indian of the first is from a Spanish-speaking
tribe, and that the Indian of the second is a
native Brazilian type.</p>

<p>And Verissimo points out that if the Indian occupies
more space in the second, his rôle is really less significant
than in <i>O Uruguay</i>.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The four lyrists of the Mineira group are Claudio
Manoel da Costa (1729-1789); Thomas Antonio Gonzaga
(1744-1807-9) the most famous of the quartet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
José Ignacio de Alvarenga Peixoto (1744-1793), and
Manoel Ignacio da Silva Alvarenga (1749-1814). Examination
of their work shows the inaccuracy of terming
them a “school,” as some Brazilian critics have loosely
done. These men did not of set purpose advance an esthetic
theory and seek to exemplify it in their writings;
they are children of their day rather than brothers-in-arms.
Like the epic poets, so they, in their verses, foreshadow
the coming of the Romanticists some fifty years
later; the spirits of the old world and the new contend in
their lines as in their lives. They are, in a sense, transition
figures, chief representatives of the “Arcadian”
spirit of the day.</p>

<p>Claudio de Costa, translator of Adam Smith’s “Wealth
of Nations,” was chiefly influenced by the Italians and
the French. Romero, in his positive way, has catalogued
him with the race of Lamartine and even called him a
predecessor of the Brazilian Byronians. A certain subjectivity
does appear despite the man’s classical leanings,
but there is nothing of him of the Childe Harold or the
Don Juan. Indeed, as often as not he is a cold stylist
and his influence, today, is looked upon as having been
chiefly technical; he was a writer rather than a thinker or
a feeler, and one of his sonnets alone has suggested the
combined influence of Camões, Petrarch and Dante:</p>

<p>The native note appears in his work, as in <i>A Fabula do
Riberão do Carmo</i> and in <i>Villa-Rica</i>, but it is neither
strong nor constant. He is of the classic pastoralists,
“the chief representative,” as Carvalho calls him, of
Arcadism in Brazil.</p>

<p>Of more enduring, more appealing stuff is the famous
lover Thomas Antonio Gonzaga, termed by Wolf a
“modern Petrarch” (for all these Arcadians must have
each his Laura) and enshrined in the hearts of his countrymen
as the writer of their Song of Songs. For that,
in a sense, is what Gonzaga’s poems to <i>Marilia</i> suggest.
No other book of love poems has so appealed to the
Portuguese reader; the number of editions through which
the <i>Marilia de Dirceu</i> has gone is second only to the printings
of <i>Os Lusiadas</i>, and has, since the original issue in
1792, reached to thirty-four. Gonzaga’s Marilia (in
real life D. Maria Joaquina Dorothea de Seixas Brandão)
rises from the verses of these <i>lyras</i> into flesh and blood
reality; the poet’s love, however much redolent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Petrarchian conventions, is no imagined passion. His heart,
as he told her in one of his most popular stanzas, was
vaster than the world and it was her abode. Gonzaga,
like Claudio, was one of the <i>Inconfidencia</i>; he fell in love
with his lady at the age of forty, when she was eighteen,
and sentimental Brazilians have never forgiven her for
having lived on to a very ripe old age after her Dirceu,
as he was known in Arcadian circles, died in exile. Yet
she may have felt the loss deeply, for a story which
Verissimo believes authentic tells of D. Maria, once
asked how old she was, replying: “When <i>he</i> was arrested,
I was eighteen.…” It is sweet enough not
to be true.</p>

<p>As Antonio José, despite his Brazilian birth, is
virtually Portuguese in culture and style, so Gonzaga,
despite his Portuguese birth, is Brazilian by virtue of his
poetic sources and his peculiar lyrism,&mdash;a blend of the
classic form with a passion which, though admirably restrained,
tends to overleap its barriers. If, as time goes
on, he surrenders his sway to the more sensuous lyrics of
later poets, he is none the less a fixed star in the poetic
constellation. He sings a type of constant love that
pleases even amid today’s half maddened and half maddening
erotic deliquescence. Some poets’ gods bring
them belief in women; his lady brings him a belief in God:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Noto, gentil Marilia, os teus cabellos;</div>
<div class="verse">E noto as faces de jasmins e rosas:</div>
<div class="verse">Noto os teus olhos bellos;</div>
<div class="verse">Os brancos dentes e as feições mimosas:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></div>

</div>

<p>The famous book is divided into two parts, the first
written before, the second, after his exile. As might be
expected; the first is primaveral, aglow with beauty, love,
joy. Too, it lacks the depth of the more sincere second,
which is more close to the personal life of the suffering
artist. He began in glad hope; he ends in dark doubt.
“The fate of all things changes,” runs one of his refrains.
“Must only mine not alter?” One unconscious testimony
of his sincerity is the frequent change of rhythm in his
lines, which achieve now and then a sweet music of
thought.</p>

<p>“<i>Marilia de Dirceu</i>,” Verissimo has written, “is of
exceptional importance in Brazilian literature. It is the
most noble and perfect idealization of love that we possess.”
(I believe that the key-word to the critic’s sentence
is “idealization.”)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> “Despite its classicism, it is
above all a personal work; it is free of and superior to,
the formulas and the rivalries of schools.… It is perhaps
the book of human passion, such as the many we
have now in our literatures that are troubled and tormented
by grief, by doubt or despair. It is, none the
less, in both our poetry and in that of the Portuguese
tongue, the supreme book of love, the noblest, the purest,
the most deeply felt, the most beautiful that has been
written in that tongue since Bernardim Ribeiro and the
sonnets of Camões.”<a name="FNanchor_9_61" id="FNanchor_9_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_61" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Of the work of Alvarenga Peixoto, translator of
Maffei’s <i>Merope</i>, author of a score of sonnets, some
odes and <i>lyras</i> and the <i>Canto Genethliaco</i>, little need here
be said. The <i>Canto Genethliaco</i> is a baptismal offering
in verse, written for the Captain-General D. Rodrigo José
de Menezes in honour of his son Thomaz; it is recalled
mainly for its “nativism,” which, as is the case with the
epic-writers, is not inconsistent with loyalty to the crown.
There is a certain Brazilianism, too, as Wolf noted, in
his <i>Ide to Maria</i>.</p>

<p>As Gonzaga had his Marilia, so the youngest of the
Mineira group, Silva Alvarenga, had his Glaura. In
him, more than in any other of the lyrists, may be noted
the stirrings of the later romanticism. He strove after,
and at times achieved a <i>côr americana</i> (“American
color”), and although he must introduce mythological
figures upon the native scene, he had the seeing eye.
Carvalho considers him the link between the Arcadians
and the Romantics, “the transitional figure between the
seventeenth-century of Claudio and the subjectivism of
Gonçalves Dias.” To the reader in search of esthetic
pleasure he is not such good company as Gonzaga and
Marilia, though he possesses a certain communicative
ardour.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The question of the authorship of the <i>Cartas Chilenas</i>,
salient among satirical writings of the eighteenth century,
has long troubled historical critics. In 1863, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the second edition of the poem appeared, it was signed
Gonzaga, and later opinion tends to reinforce that claim.
If the query as to authorship is a matter more for history
than for literature, so too, one may believe, is the poem
itself, which, in the figure of <i>Fanfarrão Minezio</i> travesties
the Governor Luis da Cunha Menezes.<a name="FNanchor_10_62" id="FNanchor_10_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_62" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Like Gregorio de Mattos, the author of the <i>Cartas</i> is
a spiteful scorpion. But he has a deeper knowledge of
things and there is more humanity to his bitterness.
“Here the Europeans diverted themselves by going on
the hunt for savages, as if hot on the chase of wild beasts
through the thickets,” he growls in one part. “There
was one who gave his cubs, as their daily food, human
flesh; wishing to excuse so grave a crime he alleged that
these savages, though resembling us in outward appearance,
were not like us in soul.” He flays the loose manners
of his day&mdash;thankless task of the eternal satirist!&mdash;that
surrounded the petty, sensuous tyrant. There is,
in his lines, the suggestion of reality, but it is a reality
that the foreigner, and perhaps the Brazilian himself,
must reconstruct with the aid of history, and this diminishes
the appeal of the verses. One need not have
known Marilia to appreciate her lover’s rhymes; the
<i>Cartas Chilenas</i>, on the other hand, require a knowledge
of Luiz de Menezes’ epoch.</p>

<p>The lesser poets of the era may be passed over with
scant mention. Best of them all is Domingos Caldas
Barbosa (1740-1800) known to his New Arcadia as
Lereno and author of an uneven collection marred by frequent
improvisation. The prose of the century, inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to the verse, produced no figures that can claim space
in so succinct an outline as this.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>On January 23, 1808, the regent Dom João fled from
Napoleon to Brazil, thus making the colony the temporary
seat of the Portuguese realm. The psychological effect
of this upon the growing spirit of independence was tremendous;
so great, indeed, was Dom João’s influence
upon the colony that he has been called the founder of
the Brazilian nationality. The ports of the land, hitherto
restricted to vessels of the Portuguese monarchy,
were thrown open to the world; the first newspapers appeared;
Brazil, having tasted the power that was bestowed
by the mere temporary presence of the monarch
upon its soil, could not well relinquish this supremacy
after he departed in 1821. The era, moreover, was one
of colonial revolt; between 1810 and 1826 the Spanish
dependencies of America rose against the motherland and
achieved their own freedom; 1822 marks the establishment
of the independent Brazilian monarchy.</p>

<p>Now begins a literature that may be properly called
national, though even yet it wavered between the moribund
classicism and the nascent romanticism, even as the
form of government remained monarchial on its slow
and dubious way to republicanism. Arcadian imagery
still held sway in poetry and there was a decline from
the originality of the Mineira group.</p>

<p>Souza Caldas (1762-1814) and São Carlos (1763-1829)
represent, together with José Eloy Ottoni (1764-1851),
the religious strains of the Brazilian lyre. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
first, influenced by Rousseau, is avowedly Christian in
purpose but the inner struggle that produced his verses
makes of him a significant figure in a generally sterile era,
and his <i>Ode ao homen selvagem</i> contains lines of appeal
to our own contemporary dubiety. São Carlos’s mystic
poem <i>A Assumpção da Santissima Virgem</i> possesses, today,
merely the importance of its nativistic naïveté; for
the third Canto, describing Paradise, he makes extensive
use of the Brazilian flora. There is, too, a long description
of Rio de Janeiro which describes very little.
José Eloy Ottoni, more estimable for his piety and his
patriotism than for his poetry, translated the Book of
Job as Souza Caldas did the Psalms, and with great success.</p>

<p>Though these religious poets are of secondary importance
to letters, they provided one of the necessary ingredients
of the impending Romantic triumph; their
Christian outlook, added to nationalism, tended to produce,
as Wolf has indicated, a genuinely Brazilian romanticism.</p>

<p>Head and shoulders above these figures stands the
patriarchal form of José Bonifacio de Andrade e Silva,
(1763-1838) one of the most versatile and able men of
his day. His scientific accomplishments have found ample
chronicling in the proper places; quickly he won a reputation
throughout Europe. “The name of José Bonifacio,”
wrote Varnhagen, “ … is so interwoven with
all that happened in the domains of politics, literature
and the sciences that his life encompasses the history of a
great period.…” His poems, in all truth but a small
part of his labours, were published in 1825 under the Arcadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
name of Americo Elysio. They are, like himself,
a thing of violent passions. In <i>Aos Bahianos</i> he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Amei a liberdade e a independencia</div>
<div class="verse">Da doce cara patria, a quem o Luso</div>
<div class="verse">Opprimia sem dó, com risa e mofa:</div>
<div class="verse">Eis o meu crime todo!<a name="FNanchor_11_63" id="FNanchor_11_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_63" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet this is but half the story, for the savant’s political
life traced a by no means unwavering line. Two years
before the publication of his poems he who so much loved
to command fell from power with the dissolution of the
Constituinte and he reacted in characteristic violence.
Brazilians no longer loved liberty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mas de tudo acabou da patria gloria!</div>
<div class="verse">Da liberdade o brado, que troava</div>
<div class="verse">Pelo inteiro Brasil, hoje enmudece,</div>
<div class="verse">Entre grilhoes e mortes.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sobre sus ruinas gemem, choram,</div>
<div class="verse">Longe da patria os filhos foragidos:</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A number of other versifiers and prose writers are included
by Brazilians in their accounts of the national
letters; Romero, indeed, with a conception of literature
more approaching that of sociology than of belles lettres,
expatiates with untiring gusto upon the work of a formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
succession of mediocrities. We have neither the
space nor the patience for them here.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is during the early part of the period epitomized in
this chapter that Brazilian literature, born of the Portuguese,
began to be drawn upon by the mother country.
“In the last quarter of the eighteenth century,”
quotes Verissimo from Theophilo Braga’s <i>Filinto Elysio</i>,
“Portuguese poetry receives an impulse of renovation
from several Brazilian talents.… They call to mind
the situation of Rome, when the literary talents of the
Gauls, of Spain and of Northern Africa, enrich Latin
literature with new creations.”</p>

<p>The period as a whole represents a decided step forward
from the inchoate ramblings of the previous epoch.
Yet, with few exceptions, it is of interest rather in retrospection,
viewed from our knowledge of the romantic
movement up to which it was leading.</p>

parallel between the two epics, it is no easy matter to indicate the exact
line between classic and romantic styles. A Frenchman has even
spoken of the romanticism of the classics, which is by no means merely
a sample of Gallic paradox. The Brazilian critic considers France the
only one of the neo-Latin literatures that may be said to possess a genuinely
classic period. As I have tried to suggest here and elsewhere, we
have need of a change in literary terminology; classic and romantic are
hazy terms that should, in time, be supplanted by something more in
consonance with the observations of modern psychology. The emphasis,
I would say, should be shifted from the subject-matter and external
aspects to the psychology of the writer and his intuitive approach.
The distinctions have long since lost their significance and should therefore
be replaced by a more adequate nomenclature.</p>

The word has been variously interpreted as signifying “dragon risen
out of the sea” (Rocha Pitta) and “son of the thunder” (Durão’s own
version), referring in the first instance to the man’s rescue from the
wreck and in the second to his arquebuse. Verissimo rejects any such
poetic interpretation and makes the topic food for fruitful observation.
He considers the Brazilian savage, as any other, of rudimentary and
scant imagination, incapable of lofty metaphorical flights. “The Indians,
infinitely less poetic than the poets who were to sing them, called Diogo
Alvares as they were in the habit of calling themselves, by the name
of an animal, tree or something of the sort. They named him Caramurú,
the name of a fish on their coast, because they caught him in the sea
or coming out of it. And to this name they added nothing marvellous,
as our active imagination has pictured.” And “this very sobriquet as
well as the epoch in which it was applied, are still swathed in legend.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>New Currents in Brazilian Poetry&mdash;Gonçalves de Magalhães,

</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Though usually associated with French literature,
the Romanticism of the first half of the
nineteenth century, like that later neo-romanticism
which nurtured the Symbolist and the Decadent
schools of the second half, came originally from Germany,
and was in essence a philosophy of self-liberation.<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
In Brazil it is thus in part applied suggestion rather than
spontaneous creation. But national creative production
thrives on cross-fertilization and self-made literatures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
as unthinkable as self-made men. There is marked difference
between mere imitation and subjection to valid influence,
and few literary phenomena in the history of the
new-world literature, north or south of Panama, attest
the truth of this better than Brazil’s period of Romanticism;
this is the richest&mdash;if not the most refined&mdash;of its
intellectual epochs. Brazilian culture is thrown open to
the currents of European thought, as its ports with the
advent of João VI had been thrown open to European
commerce, and receives from romanticism, in the words
of Wolf, the “ideal consecration” of its nativism. And
herein, of course, lies the great distinction between the
mere nativism which is so easily taken for a national
note, and that nationalism which adds to the exaltation
of the milieu the spiritual consciousness of unity and independence.
A national literature, in the fuller sense, is
now possible because it is the expression not solely of
an aspiration but of partial accomplishment, with a historic
background in fact. Poetry becomes more varied;
the novel takes more definite form; genuine beginnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
are made in the theatre, though, despite valiant attempts
to prove the contrary, the Brazilian stage is the least of
its glories.</p>

<p>Carvalho, selecting the four representative poets of
the period, has characterized each by the trait most
prominent in his work. Thus Gonçalves de Magalhães
(1811-1882) stands for the religious phase of Brazilian
romanticism; Gonçalves Dias (1823-1864) for the naturistic;
Alvarez de Azevedo (1831-1852) for the poetry
of doubt, and Castro Alves (1847) for the muse of
social reclamation, particularly the abolition of black
slavery. This group is but a solo quartet in a veritable
chorus of singers that provides a variegated setting. The
individual songs resound now more clearly, like so many
strains in the polyphonic hymn of national liberation.
The salient four are by no means restricted to the style of
verse indicated by their classification, but such a grouping
helps to emphasize the main currents of the new
poetry.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In 1832, when Magalhães published his first collection,
<i>Poesias</i>, he was a conventional worshipper of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Portuguese classics. A visit to Europe in 1833 converted
him thoroughly to French Romanticism and when,
three years later, he issued the <i>Suspiros poeticos e Saudades</i>
(Poetic Sighs and Longings), the very title proclaimed
the advent of a new orientation. His invocation
to the angel of poesy is in itself a miniature declaration
of poetic independence:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The chaste virgins of Greece, as he announces in the lines
preceding this virtual, if distinctly minor <i>ars poetica</i>,
have fascinated his childhood enough. Farewell Homer;
the poet will dream now of his native land and sigh,
amid the cypress, a song made of his own griefs and longings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Nature, fatherland and God guiding humanity are
the trinity of his emblem. They are his constant thought
at home and abroad. “Nothing for me,” he exclaims in
his <i>Deos e o Homem</i>, written in the Alps in 1834, “for
my fatherland all.” In these <i>Suspiros</i> form becomes
fairly free, rhythm alters with change in the thought; it
is difficult to point to anything in them that has not already
appeared in Brazilian poetry from the earliest
days, but the same outward elements of religion, patriotism
and subjectivity have been fused into a more personal,
more appealing product. <i>Os Mysterios</i>, a funereal canticle
in memory of his children, published in Paris in
1858, is in eight cantos that sing the triumph of faith.
As he wrote in his philosophical work issued in this same
year, <i>Factos de Espiritu Humano</i>: “This world would
be a horrible comedy, a causeless illusion, and human
existence a jest perpetrated by nothingness,&mdash;all would
be but a lie, if there were not a just and kind God!…
That which is absurd cannot be true. God exists and the
human spirit is immortal in that knowledge.” There is
the kernel of his poetry. <i>Urania</i>, Vienna 1862, chants
love through the symbol of his wife. The epic attempt,
<i>A Confederação dos Tamoyos</i>, in ten cantos, is noteworthy
not so much for lofty flights as for its evidence of
the author’s blending of the patriotic and the religious
motives. The attitude toward the Jesuit missionaries
is the opposite to the stand taken by Basilio da Gama in
the <i>Uruguay</i>; they alone among the Portuguese are
worthy; the Indians yield at last to civilization, but they
are idealized into defenders of justice against the Portuguese
exploiters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>In his epic he underwent the influence of Gonçalves
Dias, as did Manoel de Araujo Porto-Alegre (1806-1879)
in his <i>Brazilianas</i> (1863). This noted painter
was also affected by the free metrical structure of the
<i>Suspiros</i> of Magalhães, as he revealed in <i>A voz da
Natureza</i> of 1835. The boresome epic <i>Colombo</i>,
seeking inspiration in the great discoverer, is commendable
for imagination rather than truly creative
poetry.</p>

<p>Gonçalves Dias is more lyrical in spirit than Magalhães,
who was rather the meditative worshipper. The
poet of nature was the first to reveal to Brazilians in its
full significance the pride of nationality, to such an extent,
indeed, that his “Americanism” became a blind hostility
toward Europe as being only a source of evil to the
new continent. In him flowed the blood of all three
races that make up the Brazilian blend and he has celebrated
each of the strains,&mdash;the Indian in <i>Os Tymbiras</i>,
<i>Poema Americano</i>, the African in <i>A Escrava</i>, the Portuguese
in the <i>Sextilhas de Frei Antão</i>. To this blend
Carvalho, not without justice, attributes the inner turmoil
of the poet’s soul. He is religious in his patriotism, just
as Magalhães is patriotic in his religion, but if his aversion
to Europe is unreasoning, his patriotism is not a
blind flag-waving:</p>

</div>

<p>It is with the name of Gonçalves Dias that “Indianism”
in Brazilian poetry is most closely associated. As
we have already seen, Verissimo indicates an important
difference between this “second” type and the first that
appeared in the epics of the Mineira poets. The native
was exalted not so much for his own sake as by intense reaction
against the former oppressors of the nation. As
early as the date of Brazil’s declaration of Independence
(September 7, 1822), numerous families had foresworn
their Portuguese patronymics and adopted indigenous
names; idealization in actual life could not go much
farther. In literature such Indianism, as in the case of
Gonçalves Dias, could serve the purpose of providing a
highly colourful background for the poetic exploitation of
the native scene.</p>

<p>Verissimo would call Gonçalves Dias the greatest
Brazilian poet, though the noted critic discovers more
genius in Basilio da Gama and in Alvares de Azevedo and
even Laurindo Rabello,&mdash;more philosophical emotion in
Junqueira Freire. And before the national criticism had
awarded Gonçalves Dias that place of honour, the people
had granted it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> “The history of our Romanticism will
recognize that the strength of this spiritual movement
came not alone from the talent of its chief authors, but
from their communion with the milieu, from the sympathy
which they found there. Our literature was then for the
first time, and perhaps the last, social.” Gonçalves Dias,
in his <i>Canção de Exilio</i>, captured the soul of his people
with a simple lyrism that the slightest exaggeration might
have betrayed into sentimental doggerel.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Minha terra tem palmeiras,</div>
<div class="verse">Onde canta o sabiá;</div>
<div class="verse">As aves que aqui gorgeam,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>These stanzas, set to music, became the property of the
nation. “If, like the Hebrews, we were to lose our
fatherland, our song of exile would be already to hand in
the <i>Canção</i> of Gonçalves Dias. With it he reached and
conquered the people and our women, who are&mdash;in all
respects&mdash;the chief element in the fame and success of
poets. And not only the people, but Brazilian literature
and poetry. Since that time the poet is rare who does
not sing his land.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>“‘All chant their fatherland,’ runs a verse by Casimiro
de Abreu, whose nostalgia proceeds directly from the
<i>Canção</i> of Gonçalves Dias. Nor does he hide this, calling
part of his verses, <i>Canções do Exilio</i>. And to the
name of Casimiro de Abreu we can add, following in the
wake of the poet of Maranhão, Magalhaes, Porto Alegre,
Alvares de Azevedo, Laurindo Rabello, Junqueira
Freire and almost all his contemporaries. In all you
will find that song, expressed as conscious or disguised
imitation. Dominated by the emotion of the Song of
Exile, Brazil made of Gonçalves Dias her favorite poet,
the elect of her feelings. The nativist instinct, so characteristic
of peoples in their infancy, found also a sympathetic
echo in his <i>Poesias Americanas</i>, and received as a
generous reparation the idealization of our primitive inhabitants
and their deeds, without inquiring into what
there was in common between them and us, into the fidelity
of those pictures and how far they served the cause of
a Brazilian literature. His lyrism, of an intensity which
then could be compared in our language only to that of
Garrett,<a name="FNanchor_5_69" id="FNanchor_5_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_69" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> whose influence is evident in it, found similarly
a response in the national feeling.”</p>

<p>Verissimo, somewhat sceptical in the matter of love as
experienced by poets, does not even care whether love
in Gonçalves Dias was imaginary or real. He counts
it the distinguishing trait of the poet that his love poems
move the reader with the very breath of authenticity.
“I find in them the external theme translated into other
words, into another form, perhaps another manner, but
with the same lofty generality with which it was sung
by the truly great, the human poets. In him love is not
the sensual, carnal, morbid desire of Alvares de Azevedo;
the wish for caresses, the yearning for pleasure characteristic
of Casimiro de Abreu, or the amorous, impotent
fury of Junqueira Freire. It it the great powerful feeling
purified by idealization,&mdash;the love that all men feel,&mdash;not
the individual passion, the personal, limited case.”</p>

<p>I am not so inclined as Verissimo to accept at full value
the statements of poets like Gonçalves Dias that they
have never felt love. It is rather that they have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
found it as they have visioned it. Indeed, this is just
what Gonçalves Dias himself has written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O amor que eu tanto amava de imo peito</div>
<div class="verse">Que nunca pude achar.</div>

<div class="verse">The love that so much I loved in my innermost heart,</div>
<div class="verse">And that never I could find.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet who wrote the lines that follow, with their
refrain,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Isso é amor e desse amor se morre</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This is love, the love of which one dies</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">must have been something more than the man
gifted with divination that Verissimo would make of
him. I would hazard the guess that Verissimo’s deductions
are based on a certain personal passionlessness of
the critic himself, whose writings reveal just such an
idealizer of love as he would find in Gonçalves Dias.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet from Gonçalves Dias to the refined, clamant voluptuousness
of Olavo Bilac is a far cry. The reason for the
difference is to be sought rather in personal constitution
than in poetic creed. Even the Romantics differ
markedly from one another, and though the Brazilian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
muse is an ardent lady (a truth which, as we shall see,
rendered anything like a genuine Parnassianism fairly
impossible in Brazil) Gonçalves Dias is after all restrained
in his expression of a passion which clearly he
felt. The passage just quoted, with all deference to
Verissimo, is not great poetry, and precisely because it
is too general. It is statement, not the unfolding of
passion in a form spontaneously created. It proves
that Gonçalves Dias loved,&mdash;one woman or many,&mdash;but
it reveals rather a certain incapacity to generalize than
a faculty for transposing the particular into the universal.</p>

<p>Alvares de Azevedo is the standard-bearer of the
Brazilian Byronists, but he should not be classed offhand
as a mere echoer of the Englishman’s strophes.
His <i>Lira dos Veinte Annos</i> is exactly what the title announces;
the lyre of a twenty-year-old, which, though
its strings give forth romantic strains of bitterness and
melancholy and imagination that have become associated
with Byron, Musset and Leopardi, sounds an individual
note as well. The poet died in his twenty-first year; it
was a death that he foresaw and that naturally coloured
his verses. “Eat, drink and love; what can the rest
avail us?” was the epigraph he took from Byron for his
<i>Vagabundo</i>. His brief, hectic career had no time for
meticulous polishing of lines; if the statue did not come
out as at first he desired, he broke it rather than recast
the metal. Not a little of his proclamative rhyming is
the swagger of his youth, which is capable, at times, of
giving to a poem so banal a quadruplicative title as “’Tis
she! ’Tis she! ’Tis she! ’Tis she!” With the frustrated
ambitions of weakness he longed for illimitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
power. In the <i>12 de Setembro</i> (his birthday) he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Fôra bello talvez sentir no craneo</div>
<div class="verse">A alma de Goethe, e reunir na fibra</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Byron, Homero e Dante;</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Like the hero of <i>Aucassin et Nicolette</i>, he prefers hell to
heaven for a dwelling-place.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">No inferno estão suavissimas bellezas,</div>
<div class="verse">Cleopatras, Helenas, Eleonoras;</div>
<div class="verse">La se namora em boa companhia,</div>
<div class="verse">Não pode haver inferno com Senhoras!<a name="FNanchor_8_72" id="FNanchor_8_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_72" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he declares in <i>O Poeta Moribundo</i>.</p>

<p>He is Brazil’s sick child par excellence, ill, like so
many after him, with the malady of the century. But
one must guard against attributing this to the morbid
pose that comes so easy at twenty. Pose there was, and
flaunting satanism, but too many of these poets in Brazil,
and in the various republics of Spanish-America died
young for one to doubt their sincerity altogether. The
mood is a common one to youth; in an age that, like the
romantic, made a literary fashion of their weakness, they
were bound to appear as they appeared once again when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Symbolism and the Decadents vanquished for a time the
cold formalism of the Parnassian school.</p>

<p>That Alvares de Azevedo, for all his millennial doubts
and despairs was a child, is attested by the following pedestrian
quatrain from the poem of the quadruplicative
title:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Mas se Werther morreu por ver Carlotta</div>
<div class="verse">Dando pão com manteiga as criancinhas,</div>
<div class="verse">Se achou-a assim mais bella,&mdash;eu mais te adoro</div>
<div class="verse">Sonhando-te a lavar as camisinhas!<a name="FNanchor_9_73" id="FNanchor_9_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_73" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thackeray’s famous parody seems here itself to be
parodied. Alvares de Azevedo’s love, if Verissimo was
right, was “um amor de cabeça,”&mdash;of the head rather
than the heart, a poet’s love, the “love of love,” without
objective reality.… “It is rather a desire to love, the
aspiration for a woman ideally beloved, than a true, personal
passion. What does it matter, however, if he give
us poems such as <i>Anima mea</i>, <i>Vida</i>, <i>Esperanças</i>, and all,
almost all, that he left us?”</p>

<p>The boy-poet is still an appreciable influence in the
national letters, as well he might be among a people inclined
to moodiness; for many years he was one of the
most widely read poets of the country, in company of his
fellow-romantics, Gonçalves Dias and Castro Alves.
Among his followers are Laurindo Rabello (1826-1864),
Junqueira Freire (1832-1855) and Casimiro
de Abreu (1837-1860),&mdash;not a long lived generation.
Rabello was a vagrant soul whose verses are saved by
evident sincerity. “I am not a poet, fellow mortals,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
sings, “and I know it well. My verses, inspired by grief
alone, are not verses, but rather the cries of woe exhaled
at times involuntarily by my soul.” He is known chiefly
as a <i>repentista</i> (improvisator) and himself spread the
popularity of his verses by singing them to his own accompaniment
upon the violin. He tried to improvise
life as well as verses, for he drifted from the cloister to
the army, from the army to medicine, with a seeming
congenital inability to concentrate. Misfortune tracked
his steps, and, as he has told us, wrung his songs from
him. Verissimo calls him one of the last troubadours,
wandering from city to city singing his sad verses and
forcing the laugh that must entertain his varying audiences.
The popular mind so confused him with the
Portuguese Bocage that, according to the same critic,
some of Bocage’s verses have been attributed to the
Brazilian.</p>

<p>“My pleasures,” he sings in his autobiographical poem
<i>Minha Vida</i> (My Life) “are a banquet of tears! A
thousand times you must have seen me, happy amidst the
happy, chatting, telling funny stories, laughing and causing
laughter. Life’s a drama, eh?” He is, indeed, as
his lines reveal, a Brazilian <i>Pagliaccio</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Junqueira Freire is of firmer stuff, though tossed about
by inner and external vicissitudes that are mirrored in
the changing facets of his verse.</p>

<p>He, too, sought&mdash;with as little fundamental sincerity
as Laurindo Rabello&mdash;solace in the monastery, which he
entered at the unmonastic age of twenty as the result of
being crossed in love. Of course he thought first of
suicide, but “the cell of a monk is also a grave,”&mdash;and a
grave, moreover, whence the volatile soul of youth may
rise in carnal resurrection. Junqueira Freire was the
most bookish of children. He read his way through the
Scriptures, Horace, Lucretius, Ovid (an unbiblical trio!)
and imbibed modern currents through Milton, Klopstock,
De Maistre, Herculano, Garrett, Lamartine, Hugo.
His prose critiques are really remarkable in so young a
person, and one sentence upon philosophy is wiser by far
than many a tome penned by the erudite. Philosophy he
found to be a “vain poetry, not of description but of
ratiocination, nothing true, everything beautiful; rather
art than science; rather a cupola than a foundation.”
Such a view of philosophy is of course not new, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is none too current. It is brilliant for a mere youth
of Romanticist Brazil&mdash;an intuitive forecast, as it were,
of Croce’s philosophy of the intuition.</p>

<p>Soon weary of the cloister walls, our poet sang his disillusionment
in lines that turn blasphemous, even as the
mother in <i>Meu filho no claustro</i> curses the God that
“tore from my arms my favorite son.…” “We all
illude ourselves!” “We conceive an
eternal paradise and when greedily we reach after it,
we find an inferno.”</p>

<p>He is, as an artist, distinctly secondary. He is more
the poet in his prose than in his poems, and I am inclined
to think that his real personality resides there.</p>

<p>Casimiro de Abreu, in Carvalho’s words, “is the most
exquisite singer of <i>saudades</i> in the older Brazilian
poetry;<a name="FNanchor_11_75" id="FNanchor_11_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_75" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> his work is a cry of love for all that lay far
away from him, his country and his family, whom he left
when but a child.”</p>

<p>In his study of Casimiro de Abreu Verissimo has some
illuminating things to say of love and wistful longing
(<i>amor e saudade</i>) in connection with the poet’s patriotism
in especial and with love of country in general.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> “It
is under the influence of nostalgia and love, for both in
him are really an ailment&mdash;that he begins to sing of
Brazil. But the Brazil that he sings in such deeply felt
verses, the Patria that he weeps … is the land in
which were left the things he loves and chiefly that unknown
girl to whom he dedicated his book. The longing
for his country, together with the charms that this
yearning increased or created, is what made him a patriot,
if, with this restriction may be applied to him an
epithet that from my pen is not a token of praise. His
nostalgia is above all the work of love,&mdash;not only the
beloved woman, but all that this loving nature loved,&mdash;the
native soil, the paternal house, country life.…
Without these two feelings, love and longing, the love of
country is anti-esthetic. If <i>Os Lusiadas</i>, with the intense
patriotism that overflows it, is the great poem it is, it
owes this greatness to them alone. It is love and longing,
the anxious nostalgia of the absent poet and the deep
grief of a high passion that impart to it its most pathetic
accents, its most lyric notes, its most human emotions,
such as the speeches of Venus and Jupiter, the sublime
episode of D. Ignes de Castro, that of Adamastor,
the Isle of Love.…”<a name="FNanchor_13_77" id="FNanchor_13_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_77" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>In Fagundes Varella (1841-1875) we have a disputed
figure of the Romantic period. Verissimo denies him
originality except in the <i>Cantico de Calvario</i>, “where
paternal love found the most eloquent, most moving,
most potent representation that we have ever read in
any language,” while Carvalho, championing his cause,
yet discovers in him a mixture of Alvares de Azevedo’s
Byronic satanism, Gonçalves Dias’s Indianism and the
<i>condoreirismo</i> of Castro Alves and Tobias Barreto. He
is a lyrist of popular inspiration and appeal, and “one of
our best descriptive poets.…” “Varella, then, together
with Machado de Assis and Luis Guimarães
Junior, is a transitional figure between Romanticism and
Parnassianism.”</p>

<p>The influence of Victor Hugo’s <i>Les Châtiments</i> was
great throughout South America and in Brazil brought
fruit chiefly in Tobias Barreto and Castro Alves, the
salient representatives of the so-called <i>condoreirismo</i>;
like the condor their language flew to grandiloquent
heights, whence the name, for which in English we have
a somewhat less flattering counterpart in the adjective
“spread-eagle.” Barreto (1839-1889) belongs rather
to the history of Brazilian culture; he was largely responsible
for the introduction of modern German thought
and exerted a deep influence upon Sylvio Romero. Alves
was less educated&mdash;his whole life covers but a span of
twenty-four years&mdash;but what he lacked in learning he
made up in sensitivity and imagination. Though he
can be tender with the yearnings of a sad youth, he becomes
a pillar of fire when he is inspired by the cause
of abolition.</p>

<p>Romero, with his customary appetite for a fight, has,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
despite his denials of preoccupation with mere questions
of priority, given himself no little trouble to prove
Barreto’s precedence in the founding of the <i>condoreiro</i>
school;<a name="FNanchor_14_78" id="FNanchor_14_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_78" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> we shall leave that matter to the historians.
Brazilians themselves, as far as concerns the esthetic element
involved, have made a choice of Alves. He is one
of the national poets. His chief works are three in
number: <i>Espumas Fluctuantes</i>, <i>Gonzaga</i> (a play) and
<i>O Poema dos Escravos</i> (unfinished). Issued separately,
the <i>Poem of the Slaves</i>, is not, as its title would imply,
a single hymn to the subjected race; it is a collection of
poems centering around the theme of servitude. He
does not dwell upon the details of that subjection; he is,
fundamentally, the orator. The abolition of slavery did
not come until 1888; on September 28, 1871, all persons
born in Brazil were declared free by law; it was such
poems as Alves’s <i>Vozes d’Africa</i> and <i>O Navio Negreiro</i>
that prepared the way for legislation which, for that
matter, economic change was already fast rendering inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_15_79" id="FNanchor_15_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_79" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Brazilian novel is a product of the Romantic
movement. Such precursors as Teixeira e Souza
(1812-1861) and Joaquim Noberto de Souza Silva
(1820-1891) belong rather to the leisurely investigator
of origins. The real beginnings are to be appreciated
in the work of Joaquim Manoel de Macedo (1820-1882)
and José de Alencar (1829-1877).</p>

<p>Macedo portrayed the frivolous society of the epoch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of Dom Pedro II. He was not so much a leader of taste
as a skilful exploiter of it. He has been called “par excellence
the novelist of the Brazilian woman”; we need
look to him, then, for little in the way of frankness or
psychological depth. To the reader of today, who has
been tossed high in the waters of the contemporary novel,
Macedo and his ilk are tame, naïve, a mite insipid.
Not that some of his pages lack a certain piquancy in
their very simplicity. His Rachel, for example, in <i>O
Moço Louro</i> (<i>The Blond Young Man</i>) can talk like
a flapper who has been reading Bernard Shaw, but we
know that love is to teach her better in the end. Macedo
was a writer for the family hearth; his language,
like his ideas, is simple. But our complex civilization
has already outdistanced him; it is not at all impossible
that in a short while he will join the other precursors and,
with the exception of his books <i>Moreninha</i> (<i>The Brunette</i>)
and <i>O Moço Louro</i>, be but a name to his countrymen
and even his countrywomen. The first, published in
1849, made his reputation; it is a tale of the triumph of
pure love. The second is after <i>The Brunette</i>, his best-known
novel, narrating the hardly original tale of the
virginal, dreamy Honorina and the free, mocking Rachel
who love the same youth; Honorina’s true love, as we
might expect, wins out, for Rachel sacrifices her passion
without letting the happy pair realize the extent of her
abnegation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>“By no means should I say that he possesses the power
of idealization of José de Alencar, the somewhat <i>précieuse</i>
quality of Taunay or the smiling, bitter pessimism
of Machado de Assis; if we wish to judge him in comparison
with them or with the writers of today, his work
pales; his modest creations disappear into an inferior
category. But accepting him in the time for which he
wrote, when the novel had not yet received the Flaubertian
esthetics that ennobled it and had not been enriched
by the realistic genius of Zola,&mdash;beside his contemporaries
Teixeria de Souza, Manoel de Almeida and Bernardo
Guimarães, he seems to us living, picturesque,
colorful, as indeed he is. I esteem him because he has
contributed to the development and the wealth of our
literature.”<a name="FNanchor_16_80" id="FNanchor_16_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_80" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>More important to the history and practice of the
Brazilian novel is José de Alencar, famous for his <i>Guarany</i>
and <i>Iracema</i>, the first of which, in the form of an
opera libretto set to music by the native composer Carlos
Gomes, has made the rounds of the operatic world.
Alencar is to the novel what Gonçalves Dias is to the
poem: the typical Indianist. But Brazilians find his
Indianism superior to that of the poet in both sincerity
and majesty. “His Indians do not express themselves
like doctors from Coimbra; they speak as Nature has
taught them, loving, living and dying like the lesser plants
and animals of the earth. Their passions are as sudden
and as violent as the tempest,&mdash;rapid conflagrations that
burst forth for an instant, flaring, glaring and soon disappearing.”<a name="FNanchor_17_81" id="FNanchor_17_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_81" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>At his best Alencar is really a poet who has chosen
prose as his medium. He uses the Indian milieu, as
Gonçalves Dias in his poetry, for the descriptive opportunities
it affords. Brazilians rarely speak of his plots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which are simplicity itself; what fascinates them, even
today, is his rich palette, which challenges comparison
even with the opulent coloration of Coelho Netto and
Graça Aranha. Chief among foreign influences were
the Frenchmen Chateaubriand, de Vigny, Balzac, Dumas,
Hugo. Our own Cooper, himself an “Indianist” contemporaneous
with Alencar, influenced the Brazilian innovator,
but not in the manner that Brazilian critics have
seemed to discern. Alencar himself, in a rare document,
has sought to refute those who find his <i>Guarany</i> a novel
in Cooper’s style. To him Cooper was, first of all, the
“poet of the sea.” As far as concerned American
poetry, Alencar’s model (and model is his own word)
was Chateaubriand. “But my master was that glorious
Nature which surrounds me, and in particular the magnificence
of the deserts which I studied in early youth
and which were the majestic portals through which I
penetrated into my country’s past.… It was from
this source, from this vast, secular book that I drew the
pages of <i>Guarany</i> and <i>Iracema</i> and many another.…
From this source, and not from the works of Chateaubriand,
still less from those of Cooper, which were only
a copy of the sublime original that I had read within my
heart.</p>

<p>“Brazil, like the United States and most other countries
of America, has a period of conquest in which the
invading race destroys the indigenous. This struggle
presents analogous characters because of the similarity of
the native tribes. Only in Peru and Mexico do they
differ.</p>

<p>“Thus the Brazilian novelist who seeks the plot of his
novel in this period of invasion cannot escape a point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
contact with the American writer. But this approximation
comes from history; it is inevitable and not the result
of imitation.</p>

<p>“If neither Chateaubriand nor Cooper had existed, the
American novel would have appeared in Brazil in due
season.</p>

<p>“Years after having written <i>Guarany</i>” (Alencar wrote
the book in his twenty-seventh year, and would have it
that the tale occurred to him in his ninth year, as he
was crossing the sertões of the North on the road from
Ceará to Bahia) “I re-read Cooper in order to verify
the observation of the critics, and I was convinced that it
is of minor importance. There is not in the Brazilian
novel a single personage whose type may be traced to
the <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>, <i>The Spy</i>, <i>Ontario</i>, <i>The Sappers
and Lionel Lincoln</i>.… Cooper considers the native
from the social point of view and was, in the description
of indigenous customs, a realist.… In <i>Guarany</i>
the savage is an ideal, which the writer tried to poetize,
divesting him of the coarse incrustation in which he
was swathed by the chroniclers, and rescuing him from
the ridicule that the stultified remnants cast upon the almost
extinct race.</p>

<p>“But Cooper, say the critics, describes American nature.
And what was he to describe if not the scene of
his drama? Walter Scott before him had provided the
model for these pen landscapes that form part of local
color.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>“What should be investigated is whether the descriptions
of <i>Guarany</i> show any relationship or affinity to
Cooper’s descriptions; but this is what the critics fail to
do, for it means work and requires thought. In the
meantime the comparison serves to show that they resemble
each other neither in genre nor style.”<a name="FNanchor_18_82" id="FNanchor_18_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_82" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The Brazilian novelist, presenting thus his own case,
hits precisely upon those two qualities&mdash;sea lore and
realism&mdash;for which Cooper only yesterday, fifty years
after Alencar wrote this piece of auto-criticism, was rediscovered
to United States readers by Professor Carl
Van Doren. “Not only did he outdo Scott in sheer
accuracy,” writes the critic of the United States novel,
“but he created a new literary type, the tale of adventure
on the sea, in which, though he was to have many
followers in almost every modern language, he has not
been surpassed for vigour and swift rush of narrative.”<a name="FNanchor_19_83" id="FNanchor_19_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_83" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Alencar is no realist nor is he concerned with sheer
accuracy. <i>Guarany</i>, the one book by which he is sure to
be remembered for many a year, is, as we have seen, a
prose poem in which the love of the Indian prince Pery
for the white Cecy, daughter of a Portuguese noble, is
unfolded against a sumptuous tapestry of the national
scene. Alencar wrote other novels, of the cities, but in
Brazilian literature he is identified with his peculiar
Indianism. From the stylistic standpoint he has been
accused of bad writing; like so many of his predecessors&mdash;and
followers&mdash;he plays occasional havoc with syntax,
as if the wild regions he depicts demanded an analogous
anarchy of language. Yet Costa, granting all this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
adds that “before José de Alencar the Portuguese language
as written in Brazil was, without exaggeration, a
horrible affair. What man today possesses sufficient
courage to brave with light heart that voluminous agglomeration
of verses in the <i>Confederacão dos Tamoyos</i>, in
<i>Colombo</i>, in <i>Caramurú</i> or <i>Uruguay</i>? In prose … but
let us rather not speak of it. It is enough to read
the novels of Teixeira de Souza and Manoel de Almeida.”<a name="FNanchor_20_84" id="FNanchor_20_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_84" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
This same style is viewed by others as a
herald of the nervous prose of another man of the sertões,
Euclydes da Cunha, who has enshrined them in one
of the central works of modern Brazil.</p>

<p><i>Sertanismo</i> itself, however, was initiated by Bernardo
Joaquim da Silva Guimarães (1827-1885) in such works
as <i>Pelo Sertão</i>, <i>Mauricio</i>, <i>Escrava Isaura</i>. He was
followed in this employment of the sertão as material
for fiction by Franklin Tavora (1842-1888) and particularly
Escragnole Taunay (1843-1899), whose <i>Innocencia</i>,
according to Verissimo, is one of the country’s
few genuinely original novels. Mérou, in 1900, called
it “the best novel written in South America by a South
American,”&mdash;a compliment later paid by Guglielmo
Ferrero to Graça Aranha’s <i>Chanaan</i>. Viscount Taunay’s
famous work&mdash;one might call it one of the central productions
of Brazilian fiction&mdash;is but scant fare to
the contemporary appetite in fiction, yet it has been
twice translated into French, and has been put into
English, Italian, German, Danish and even Japanese.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in the deserted Matto Grosso, a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
background of the author’s. Innocencia, all that her
name implies, dwells secluded with her father, a miner,
her negress slave Conga and her Caliban-like dwarf Tico,
who is in love with Innocencia, the Miranda of this district.
Into her life comes the itinerant physician Cirino
de Campos, who is called by her father to cure her of
the fever. Cirino proves her Ferdinand; they make love
in secret, for she is meant by paternal arrangement for a
mere brute of a mule-driver, Manecão by name. Innocencia
vows herself to Cirino, when the mule-driver comes
to enforce his prior claim; the father, bound by his word
of honour, sides with the primitive lover. Innocencia
resists; Manecão avenges himself by killing the doctor.
A comic figure of a German scientist adds humour and
a certain poignant irony to the tale.</p>

<p>Students of Spanish-American letters are acquainted
with the Colombian novel <i>Maria</i> by the half-Jew Jorge
Isaacs; it has been termed a sister work to <i>Innocencia</i>
and if it happens to be, as is my opinion, superior to the
Brazilian, a comparison reveals complementary qualities
in each. The Spanish-American work is rather an
idyll, instinct with poetry; <i>Innocencia</i>, by no means devoid
of poetry, is more melodramatic and of stouter texture.
Taunay, in Brazilian fiction, is noted for having
introduced an element of moderation in passion and
characterization, due perhaps to his French provenience.
His widely-known account of an episode in
the war with Paraguay was, indeed, first written in
French.</p>

<p>Manoel Antonio de Almeida (1830-1861) in his
<i>Memorias de um Sargento de Milicias</i> had made a premature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
attempt to introduce the realistic novel; his early
death robbed the nation of a most promising figure.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The theatrical literature of Brazil is poor; the origin
of the modern drama is generally attributed to Magalhães’
tragedy upon Antonio José, 1838, and to the comedies
of Luis Carlos Martins Penna (1815-1848). Of
drama there is no lack; all that is needed is the dramatist.
Martins Penna stands out easily from the ruck
for elementary realism, but he is almost alone. Even
today, the plays of Claudio de Souza, for all their success
upon the stage, cannot compare with the quality that
may be encountered in contemporary poetry, novels and
tales.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Romantic period in Brazil is distinguished as
much for activity as for actual accomplishment; historically
it is of prime importance in the national development,
while esthetically it reveals a certain broadening
of interests. The national writer, as a type, has attained
his majority; he gazes upon broader horizons. Yet take
away <i>Guarany</i>, <i>Iracema</i>, <i>Innocencia</i>, <i>O Moço Louro</i>,
<i>Moreninha</i>, and what, really, is left in prose? The
poets fare better; they are nearer to the sentient heart of
things. Yet implacable esthetic criteria would do away
with much of their product as well. It is by such tokens
as these that one may recognize the secondary importance
of the national letters, for, of course, Brazilian
letters do not constitute a major literature. Here it is
the salient individual that counts, and I, for one, am inclined
to think that in art such an individual, as bodied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
forth in his work, is the <i>only</i> thing that counts. The
rest&mdash;genres, evolution, periods,&mdash;is important in the
annals of national development; it is, however, sociology,
history, what you will, but not the primary concern of
art.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_65" id="Footnote_1_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_65"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> “True Romanticism,” says Wolf, “is nothing other than the expression
of a nation’s genius unrestrained by the trammels of convention.”
He would derive the name through the same reasoning that called the
<i>lingua romana rustica</i> (country Roman speech) Romance, as in the
phrase Romance Languages, in opposition to the learned Latin known
as the <i>sermo urbanus</i>, or language of the city. Such liberation as Wolf
points out, was the work of German criticism. “The Germans avenged
themselves for the double servitude, political and literary, with which
the French had so long oppressed them, by at last delivering the people
from the pseudo-classic fetters.” A service they performed a half-century
later, as we have suggested, bringing a new breath to the later
pseudo-classicism of the Parnassians. The real contribution of the so-called
Romantic movement, then, was one of release from academically
organized repression,&mdash;repression in form, in thought, in expression,
which are but so many aspects of the genetic impulse, and not detachable
entities that may be re-arranged at will. The measure of literary
repression may be taken as one of the measures of classicism; the measure
of release from that repression may be taken as one of the measures
of romanticism. To argue in favour of one or the other or to attempt
to draw too definite a line between them is a futile implication
of the possibility of uniformity and, moreover, is to shift the criteria of
art from an esthetic to a moralistic basis. There are really as many
“isms” as there are creative individuals; classic and romantic are aspects
of all creative endeavour rather than definite and opposing qualities.
The observation which I translate herewith from Wolf relates Romanticism
to its originally individualistic importance as applied to nations.
“The accessory ideas that have been grafted upon that of Romanticism
as a result of its decadence,” writes the German critic, “serve only
to confuse the etymological and historical truth of this definition. It is for
the same reasons that the art of the Middle Ages, proper to modern
peoples and opposed to antiquity, has been named Romantic, or rather,
Roman. In order to re-establish the continuity of their spontaneous development
and to paralyze the modern influence of the humanists, the
reformists, classicism and rationalism, these same peoples had to turn
back and drink from the ever abundant springs of the Middle Ages,&mdash;a
brilliant epoch of development which was more in conformity with
their genius. This is another reason why the two terms Middle Ages
and Romanticism have been confused. But as this poetry and art of
the Middle Ages are bigoted, excessively idealistic, taking pleasure in
mysticism and the fantastic, these diverse acceptations have been wrongly
given to romanticism. Taking the accessory for the central nucleus,
modern romanticism has caricatured all this and discredited true romanticism,
so that the name in the realms of art has been applied to everything
that is subjective, arbitrary, nebulous, capricious and without fixed
form.”</p>

“In no other Brazilian poets do I find, together with a banal facility

quality of these poets (that is, of those whom Verissimo groups into
the second Romantic generation, including Gonçalves Dias, Alvares de
Azevedo, Casimiro de Abreu, Junqueiro Freire, Laurindo Rabello) is
their nationalism. Not that factitious nationalism of duty or erudition,
in which intention and process are clearly discernible, but the expression&mdash;unconscious,
so to say&mdash;of the national soul itself, in its feeling, its manner
of speech, its still rudimentary thought. They are not national because
they speak of <i>bores</i>, <i>tacapes</i> or <i>inubias</i>, or sing the savages that
rove these lands. With the exception of Gonçalves Dias, none of them
is even ‘Indianist.’ Casimiro de Abreu, upon whom Gonçalves Dias
made so great an impression, whose nostalgia derives largely from the
<i>Cançõ do Exilio</i> (Song of Exile) no longer sings the Indian. Neither
do Alvares de Azevedo, Laurindo or the others.” <i>Estudos</i>, II, Pages

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The later course of Brazilian letters follows practically
the same line traced by the reaction in
France against the Romantic school. To and
fro swings the pendulum of literary change in unceasing
oscillation between dominance of the emotions and rule
of the intellect. Life, as Havelock Ellis somewhere has
shown, is an eternal process of “tumescence and detumescence”;
the formula is quite true of literature. Buds
and human beings alike swell to maturity in the womb of
nature and then follows the inevitable contraction. So,
in letters, the age of full expression is succeeded by one
of repressed art,&mdash;the epoch of a blatant proclamative
“ism” by an era of restraint and withdrawal. Who
shall, in <i>a priori</i> fashion, pretend to say that this “ism”
is right and that one wrong? By their works alone shall
ye know them.</p>

<p>If, then, Romanticism in France, as subsequently elsewhere,
gave way to a rapid succession of inter-reacting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
schools or groups, the phenomenon was the familiar one
of literary oscillation. The Naturalists, nurtured upon
advancing science, looked with scorn upon the emotional
extravagances of the Romantics. To excessive preoccupation
with the ego and with unreality, they opposed
the critical examination and documentation of reality.
Milieu, social environment, psychology ceased to be idealized;
enthusiasm and exaltation were succeeded by cold
scrutiny. The doctrine of “impersonality” (a most inartistic
and psychologically impossible creed) was crystallized
around the powerful literary personality of Flaubert,
and Romantic egolatry looked as silly in the searching
day of the new standards as last night’s flowers without
the breath of spring and the moonlight that excuse
the sweet folly they incite.</p>

<p>In poetry the Parnassians revolted against Romantic
self-worship on the one hand and the realistic preoccupation
of the naturalists on the other. They, too, believed
themselves impersonal, impassive&mdash;terms only relative
in creative endeavour. They climbed up their ivory
towers, away from vulgar mundanity, and substituted for
the musical vagaries of their unrepressed predecessors
the cult of the clear image and the sculptural line. And
fast upon them followed the Symbolist-Decadents,&mdash;some
of whom, indeed, were nourished upon the milk of
Parnassianism,&mdash;and who, in their turn, abjured the
modern classicism of the Parnassians with their cult of
form and clarity, and set up instead a new musicality of
method, a new intensity of personalism. Their ivory
towers were just as high, but were reared on subtler
fancies. Suggestion replaced precision; sculpture melted
into music. In a word, already neo-classicism had swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to neo-romanticism; the pendulum, on its everlasting
swing, had covered the same distance in far faster time.
Yet each seeming return to the old norms is a return
with a difference; more and more the basic elements of
the reaction are understood by the participants in their
relations to society and to the individual. Especially is
their psychological significance appreciated and&mdash;most
important of all and most recent&mdash;their nature as complements
rather than as antagonists. When Darío, in a
famous poem, asked “¿Quien quieñ es no es Romántico?”
(Who that is, is not a Romantic?) he but stressed the
individualism at the bottom of all art. Perhaps the days
of well-defined “schools” in art are over; perhaps the
days of the label in criticism are gone, or going fast, even
in academic circles; all men contain the potentialities of
all things and opposites grow out of opposites. Man is
thus himself unity in variety,&mdash;the old shibboleth of the
estheticists,&mdash;and the “schools” are but phases of the
multiple personality.</p>

<p>The reaction against Romanticism, if varied in France,
was even less disciplined in Ibero-America. And here
we come upon a curious fact in comparative literature that
is deserving of investigation. In the first place, Parnassianism
in Brazil (and in Spanish America, for that
matter) was hardly ever the frigidly perfect thing it became
in the hands of the Frenchman. A certain tropical
warmth is bound, in the new-world poets, to glow in the
marble veins of their sonnets. In the second,&mdash;and this
is truly peculiar,&mdash;that Symbolism (especially in its Decadent
phase) which was responsible for a fundamental
renovation of letters in Spanish America and later affected
Spain itself, passed over Brazil with but scant influence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Brazil produced some highly interesting Parnassians
(with proper reservations made in the use of that term);
Bilac, in his realm, is the peer of any Spanish American.
But the Portuguese-speaking republic shows no figure approaching
the epochal Rubén Darío, whose life and
labours fairly sum up the modernist era in Spanish
America.<a name="FNanchor_1_85" id="FNanchor_1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_85" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The scientific spirit in Brazilian poetry was of short
duration, even though Romero, one of its chief exponents,
gives himself credit for having initiated in 1870 the
reaction against Romanticism with a poetry that sought
harmony with the realistic philosophy of the day. He
and Martins Junior (whom Carvalho places at the head
of the “scientific” poets) are today considered to have
troubled the waters of Brazilian lyrism for but a passing
moment. In reality, they but hastened the advent
of Parnassianism. Brazil for a while was weary
of the great Latin weakness,&mdash;eloquence. Its poetical
condors had too long orated from mountain-tops; it was
high time for swans, for towers of ivory. Besides, I believe,
this answered a certain need of the national psyche.
The sensualist, too, has his moments of refinement, and
he becomes the exquisite voluptuary. Science in poetry,
as exemplified by the strophes of Martins Junior, is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
often but rhymed harangue, even as the early Brazilian
versifiers presented us with rhymed fruit-baskets, aviaries
and geographies. Note the unscientific worship of
science in his lines,&mdash;that science which so prosaically he
terms “o grande agente altruista,” the great altruistic
agent:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The transition from Romanticism to Parnassianism in
Brazil may be studied in the poetry of Luiz Guimarães
and the earlier verses of Machado de Assis. I find it
difficult to agree with either Verissimo or Carvalho in
his estimate of Machado de Assis’s poetry; Romero
has by far the more tenable view. It may be true that the
<i>Chrysalidas</i> and the <i>Phalenas</i> of Machado de Assis, like
the <i>Sonetos e Rimas</i> of Luiz Guimarães, reveal a great
refinement of form and elegance of rhyme,&mdash;even a
wealth of rhythm. But colour and picturesqueness are
hardly the distinguishing poetic traits of Machado de
Assis, whose real poetry, as I try to show in the chapter
dedicated especially to him, is in his prose.</p>

<p>Luiz Guimarães was, from one aspect, a Romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
with a more precise technique; his form, in other words,
was quite as transitional as his content. In addition to
French influence he underwent that of the Italians Stecchetti
and Carducci, of whom he made translations into
Portuguese. His sonnet on Venice is illustrative of a
number of his qualities,&mdash;his restrained <i>saudade</i>, his gift
of picturesque evocation, his rich rhymes, his vocalic melody:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Machado de Assis,” writes Carvalho,<a name="FNanchor_4_88" id="FNanchor_4_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_88" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> “was a poet of
greater resources and fuller metrical invention than Luiz
Guimarães. His poetry … reveals a psychological
intensity rarely attained in this country. Possessing a
firm classical education, a profound knowledge of those
humanities which in seventeenth century France were the
distinguishing characteristic of the <i>honnête homme</i>,
Machado succeeded in stamping upon his verses a truly
singular impress of subtlety and discretion. His images
are, as a rule, of a perfect realism, a clearness worthy
of the old masters. His images are veritable parables.…”
But, to one foreigner at least,&mdash;and, I
suspect, to more than one Brazilian, Machado de Assis
as a poet is cold, not often achieving artistic communication;
he is colourful, maybe, but his colours are seen
through a certain diaphanous mist that rubs off their
bloom. What Carvalho would find in the man’s verses I
discover, strangely enough, in his remarkable prose&mdash;his
humorism, his pessimism. The themes most certainly
inhere in his verse, but they are expressed at their
best, most artistically developed, in his prose. Carvalho,
seeking to rectify the position of this great figure in the
history of Brazilian letters, would even make of him a
pioneer. “This feeling of the <i>tragico quotidiano</i>,” he asserts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
“which only today is beginning to enter into Brazilian
poetry, was first revealed to our literature by Machado
de Assis. Although such notes are not frequent nor
many in his work, it is none the less true that, before him,
they were completely unknown.… Even in his poetry,
his poetry that has been so unjustly judged and so pettily
understood, Machado de Assis is a pioneer, an originator
of the first order. It was natural for his art not to be
to the taste of the popular palate; it did not resound
with the fireworks and the hoarse cries of Brazil’s most
loudly applauded verse-manufacturers.”<a name="FNanchor_5_89" id="FNanchor_5_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_89" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Pioneering, however, is not poetry. In art, the idea
belongs to him who makes the best use of it. In Machado
de Assis, the thought often subjected the emotion;
this was characteristic of the man’s peculiar psychology.
I would not be understood as denigrating his poetic
memory; far from it. But in my opinion (and I can
speak for no one else) he is in the conventional sense,
only secondarily a poet, and a secondary poet.</p>

<p>At the head of the true Parnassians stand Theophilo
Dias, Raymundo Correia, Alberto de Oliveira and Olavo
Bilac, though Verissimo sees in the <i>Miniaturas</i> of Gonçalves
Crespo “the first manifestation of Parnassian
poetry published here.”<a name="FNanchor_6_90" id="FNanchor_6_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_90" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Crespo was not out-and-out
Parnassian, however, as was Affonso Celso in his <i>Telas
sonantes</i> of 1876. The very title&mdash;Sounding Canvases,
i. e., pictures that sing their poetry&mdash;is in itself a program.
Brazilian Parnassianism thus begins, according to
Verissimo, in the decade 1880-1890. <i>Sonetos e Rimas</i>,
by Luiz Guimarães, appears in 1879; Raymundo Correia’s
<i>Symphonias</i> are of 1883, his <i>Versos e Versões</i>, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
1884; Alberto de Oliveira’s <i>Meridionaes</i> are of 1884,
and the <i>Sonetas e poemas</i> of 1886. In the very year that
the Nicaraguan, Darío, with a tiny volume of prose and
poetry called <i>Azul…</i> and published in Chile, was initiating
the “modernist” overturn in Spanish America,
Bilac was issuing (1888) his <i>Poesias</i>.</p>

<p>Brazilian Parnassianism, as we have seen, is less objective,
less impersonal than its French prototype. Poetic
tradition and national character were alike opposed to
the Gallic finesse, erudition, ultra-refinement. Pick up
the many so-called Parnassian poems of Spanish or Portuguese
America, remove the names of the authors and the
critical excrescences, and see how difficult it is&mdash;<i>from the
evidence of the poem itself</i>&mdash;to apply the historical label.</p>

<p>Theophilo Dias is hardly the self-controlled chiseller of
Greek marbles. How “Parnassian,” for example, is
such a verse as this, speaking of his lady’s voice?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Exerce sobre mim um brando despotismo</div>
<div class="verse">Que me orgulha, e me abate;&mdash;e ha nesse magnetismo</div>
<div class="verse">Uma forca tamanha, uma electricidade,</div>
<div class="verse">Que me fascina e prende as bordas de um abysmo,</div>
<div class="verse">Sem que eu tente fugir,&mdash;inerte, sem vontade.<a name="FNanchor_7_91" id="FNanchor_7_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_91" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not the kind of thought that produces genuine
Parnassian poetry. How “impersonal” is it? How
“sculptural”? More than one poem of the “Romanticist”
Machado de Assis is far more Parnassian.</p>

<p>And listen to this description, by Carvalho, of Raymundo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Correia. How “Parnassian” does it sound?
“Anger, friendship, hatred, jealousy, terror, hypocrisy,
all the tints and half-tints of human illusion, all that is
closest to our innermost heart … he weighed and
measured, scrutinized and analysed with the patient care
of a naturalist who was, at the same time, a prudent and
well-informed psychologist. Nor is this all.… Raymundo
is an admirable painter of our landscape, an <i>exquisite
impressionist</i>, who reflects, with delicious sentiment,
the light and shade of the Brazilian soil.”<a name="FNanchor_8_92" id="FNanchor_8_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_92" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>There is no denying the beneficial influence of the Parnassians
upon the expressive powers of the Brazilian
poets. The refinement of style mirrored a refinement of
the thought. If I stress the difference between the
French and the Brazilian Parnassians it is not alone to
emphasize the partial inability of the latter to imitate the
foreign models, but to show how genuine personality
must triumph over group affiliations. Raymundo Correia
was such a personality; his sensibility was too responsive
for complete surrender to formula. One of
his sonnets long enjoyed the reputation of being the most
popular ever penned in his country:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">

</div>
<div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the more yearnful voice of Raymundo Correia’s
muse, who knows, too, the futility of rebellion against
“God, who cruelly creates us for grief; God, who created
us and who was not created.” This conception of universal
grief is his central theme, and it is significant that
when Carvalho seeks spiritual analogies he goes&mdash;to Parnassians?
No. To Leopardi, to Byron, to Pushkin,
to Buddha.</p>

<p>Alberto de Oliveira, genuine artist that he was&mdash;and
it was the fashion at one time for the Brazilian poets,
under Parnassian influence, to call themselves artists
rather than poets&mdash;maintained his personality through
all his labours. Like a true Brazilian, he renders homage
to the surrounding scene and even his sadness is several
parts softness. In the manner of the day he wrote many
a sonnet of pure description, but this represents restraint
rather than predilection, for at other times, as in his <i>Volupia</i>,
he bursts out in a nostalgia for love that proves his
possession of it even at the moment of his denial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Fico a ver que tudo ama. E eu não amo, eu sómente!</div>
<div class="verse">Ama este chão que piso, a arvore a que me encosto,</div>
<div class="verse">Esta aragem subtil que vem roçar-me o rosto,</div>
<div class="verse">Estas azas que no ar zumbem, esta folhagem,</div>
<div class="verse">As féras que no cio o seu antro selvagem</div>
<div class="verse">Deixam por ver a luz que as magnetiza, os broncos</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Note how similar are these verses in content to the cries
of love denied that rise from Gonçalves Dias and Casimiro
de Abreu,&mdash;two Romantics of the movement’s
height. Carvalho, too, sees that in Alberto de Oliveira
there is, in addition to the talent for description, “a subjective
poet of genuine value.”</p>

<p>For a long time Olavo Bilac enjoyed the sobriquet
“Prince of Brazilian poets.” It matters little that part
of his posthumous book, <i>Tarde</i>, reveals a social preoccupation.
To the history of Brazilian letters, and to his
countrymen, he is first of all the resounding voice of voluptuousness.
And, as happens so often with the ultra-refined
of his kin, the taste of his ecstasies at times is
blunted by the <i>memento mori</i> of weary thought. The
world becomes a pendulum swinging between vast contrasts,
and it takes both swings to complete the great vibration.</p>

<p>The theme is as common as joy and sorrow; at the very
beginning of Brazilian literature we meet it in a coarser
sensualist, Gregorio de Mattos Guerra. In Raymundo
Correia, in Machado de Assis, such rhymed homilies are
common. They illustrate rather the philosophical background
of the poets than their more artistic creativeness.
Voluptuary that he was, Bilac preferred in poetry the
carefully wrought miniature to the Titanic block of
marble; at his best he attains a rare effect of eloquent
simplicity. He was as Parnassian as a Brazilian may be
in verse, yet more than once, as he chiselled his figurines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
they leaped to life under his instrument, like diminutive
Galateas under the breath of Pygmalion.</p>

</div>

<p>“Thus I proceed,” he declares in the poem that opens his
<i>Poesias</i>, presenting his particular <i>ars poetica</i>. “My pen
follows this standard. To serve you, Serene Goddess,
Serene Form!” Yet read the entire poem; note, as an
almost insignificant detail, the numerous exclamation
points; note, too, that he is making love to that Goddess,
that he is promising to die in her service. The words are
the words of Parnassianism, but the voice is the voice of
passionate personality, romantically dedicated to Style.
Indeed, for the epigraph to his entire work one might
quote the lines from Musset’s “Rolla”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">J’aime!&mdash;voilà le mot que la nature entière</div>
<div class="verse">Crie au vent qui l’emporte, à l’oiseau qui le suit!</div>
<div class="verse">Sombre et dernier soupir que poussera la terre</div>
<div class="verse">Quand elle tombera dans l’eternelle nuit!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bilac’s passion at its height may replace the Creator of
life himself; thus, in <i>A Alvorada do Amor</i>, Adam, before
his Eve, cries ecstatically his triumph, despite their
lost paradise. He blesses the moment in which she revealed
her sin and life with her crime, “For, freed of
God, redeemed and sublime, I remain a man upon earth,
in the light of thine eyes. Earth, better than Heaven;
Man, greater than God!”</p>

<p>All, or almost all, of Bilac, is in this poem, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
thus one of his pivotal creations. De Carvalho has
termed him a poet of “pansexualism”; the name might
be misleading, as his verses more often reveal the gourmet,
rather than the gourmand of eroticism.<a name="FNanchor_12_96" id="FNanchor_12_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_96" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The more to show the uncertain nature of Brazilian
Parnassianism, we have the figures of Luiz Delfino and
Luiz Murat, termed by some Parnassians and by others
Romantics. Delfino has been called by Romero (<i>Livro
do Centenario</i>, Vol. I, page 71), “for the variety and extent
of his work, the best poet of Brazil.” The same
critic, some thirty-three pages farther along in the same
account, calls Murat deeper and more philosophic than
Delfino, and equalled only by Cruz e Souza in the penetration
of the human soul. And by the time (page 110,
<i>Ibid.</i>) he has reached the last-named of these poets,
Cruz e Souza becomes “in many respects the best poet
Brazil has produced.”</p>

<p>Yet the effect of the French neo-classicists upon the
Brazilian poets was, as Verissimo has shown, threefold:
form was perfected, the excessive preoccupation with
self was diminished, the themes became more varied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
“This same influence, following the example of what had
happened in France, restored the sonnet to the national
poetry, whence the Romantics had almost banished it,
and on the other hand banished blank verse, which
is so natural to our tongue and our poetry.… As
to form, our Parnassian poets merely completed the evolution
led in Portugal and there by two poets who,
whatever their merits, had a vast effect upon our poetry,
Antonio de Castilho and Thomaz Ribeiro. Machado de
Assis evidently and confessedly owes to the first, if not
also to the second, the advantages of his metrification
and of his poetic form in general over that of some of his
contemporaries, such as Castro Alves and Varella. Parnassianism
refined this form … with its preoccupations
with relief and colour, as in the plastic arts,&mdash;with exquisite
sonorities, as in music,&mdash;with metrical artifices that
should heighten mere correctness and make an impression
through the feeling of a difficulty conquered,&mdash;with the
search for rich rhymes and rare rhymes, and, as in prose,
for the adjective that was peregrine, and if not exact,
surprising. All this our poets did here as a strict imitation
of the French, and since it is the externality of things
that it is easy and possible to imitate and not that which
is their very essence, a great number of them merely reproduced
in pale copy the French Parnassians.
Thus, for some fifteen years, we were truly inundated
with myriads of sonnets describing domestic scenes, landscapes,
women, animals, historic events, seascapes, moonlight
… a veritable gallery of pictures in verse that
pretended to be poetry.”</p>

<p>Here, as everywhere else, the true personalities survive.
Chief among the Brazilian Parnassians are the
few whom we have here considered.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The naturalistic novel in Brazil is, from the artistic
standpoint, the work of some four men,&mdash;Machado de
Assis, Aluizio de Azevedo, Julio Ribeiro and Raul Pompeia.
Ribeiro’s <i>Carne</i> (Flesh) and Pompeia’s <i>Atheneu</i>
represent, respectively, the influence of Zola upon the
natural sensuousness of the Brazilian and the impact of
complex modernity upon that sensuousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The prose work of Machado de Assis is not exclusively
naturalistic; indeed, he should be considered, though
of his age, a spirit apart; as he rises above the limitations
of Brazilian letters, so he is too big for any circumscribed
epoch to contain. With the year 1879 he began a long
period of maturity that was to last for thirty years. It
was during this fruitful phase that he produced the
<i>Memorias Postumas de Braz Cubas</i>, <i>Quincas Borba</i>,
<i>Historias Sem Data</i>, <i>Dom Casmurro</i>, <i>Varias Historias</i>,
and other notable works. His long fiction, as his short,
exhibits the same bitter-sweet philosophy and gracious,
yet penetrating irony. In the best of his prose works
he penetrates as deep as any of his countrymen into the
abyss of the human soul.</p>

<p>The judgment of Verissimo upon Machado de Assis
differs somewhat from that of his distinguished compatriots.</p>

<p>“With <i>Varias Historias</i>,” he says in his studies of
Brazilian letters, “Sr. Machado de Assis published his
fifteenth volume and his fifth collection of tales.…
To say that in our literature Machado de Assis is a figure
apart, that he stands with good reason first among our
writers of fiction, that he possesses a rare faculty of
assimilation and evolution which makes him, a writer of
the second Romantic generation, always a contemporary,
a modern, without on this account having sacrificed
anything to the latest literary fashion or copied some
brand-new esthetic, above all conserving his own distinct,
singular personality … is but to repeat what has been
said many times already. All these judgments are confirmed
by his latest book, wherein may be noted the same
impeccable correctness of language, the same firm grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
upon form, the same abundancy, force and originality of
thought that make of him the only thinker among our
writers of fiction, the same sad, bitter irony.…</p>

<p>“After that there was published another book by Sr.
Machado de Assis, <i>Yaya Garcia</i>. Although this is really
a new edition, we may well speak of it here since the
first, published long before, is no longer remembered by
the public. Moreover, this book has the delightful and
honest charm of being in the writer’s first manner.</p>

<p>“But let us understand at once, this reference to Machado
de Assis’s first manner. In this author more than
once is justified the critical concept of the unity of works
displayed by the great writers. All of Machado de
Assis is practically present in his early works; in fact, he
did not change, he scarcely developed. He is the most
individual, the most personal, the most ‘himself’ of our
writers; all the germs of this individuality that was to
attain in <i>Bras Cubas</i>, in <i>Quincas Borba</i>, in the <i>Papeis
Avulsos</i> and in <i>Varias Historias</i> its maximum of virtuosity,
may be discovered in his first poems and in his earliest
tales. His second manner, then, of which these
books are the best example, is only the logical, natural,
spontaneous development of his first, or rather, it is the
first manner with less of the romantic and more of the
critical tendencies.… The distinguishing trait of
Machado de Assis is that he is, in our literature, an artist
and a philosopher. Up to a short time ago he was the
only one answering to such a description. Those who
come after him proceed consciously and unconsciously
from him, some of them being mere worthless imitators.
In this genre, if I am not misemploying that term, he
remained without a peer. Add that this philosopher is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
pessimist by temperament and by conviction, and you will
have as complete a characterization as it is possible to
design of so strong and complex a figure as his in two
strokes of the pen.</p>

<p>“<i>Yaya Garcia</i>, like <i>Resurreição</i> and <i>Helena</i>, is a romantic
account, perhaps the most romantic written by the
author. Not only the most romantic, but perhaps the
most emotional. In the books that followed it is easy
to see how the emotion is, one might say, systematically
repressed by the sad irony of a disillusioned man’s realism.”
Verissimo goes on to imply that such a work as
this merits comparison with the humane books of Tolstoi.
But this only on the surface. “For at bottom, it contains
the author’s misanthropy. A social, amiable misanthropy,
curious about everything, interested in everything&mdash;what
is, in the final analysis, a way of loving mankind
without esteeming it.…</p>

<p>“The excellency with which the author of <i>Yaya Garcia</i>
writes our language is proverbial.… The highest distinction
of the genius of Machado de Assis in Brazilian
literature is that he is the only truly universal writer we
possess, without ceasing on that account to be really Brazilian.”</p>

<p>When the Brazilian Academy of letters was founded in
1897, Machado de Assis was unanimously elected president
and held the position until his death. Oliveira
Lima, who lectured at Harvard during the college season
of 1915-1916, and who is himself one of the most intellectual
forces of contemporary Brazil, has written of
Machado de Assis:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> “By his extraordinary talent as
writer, by his profound literary dignity, by the unity of a
life that was entirely devoted to the cult of intellectual
beauty, and by the prestige exerted about him by his work
and by his personality, Machado de Assis succeeded, despite
a nature that was averse to acclaim and little inclined
to public appearance, in being considered and respected as
the first among his country’s men-of-letters: the head, if
that word can denote the idea, of a youthful literature
which already possesses its traditions and cherishes above
all its glories.… His life was one of the most regulated
and peaceful after he had given up active journalism,
for like so many others, he began his career as a political
reporter, paragrapher and dramatic critic.”<a name="FNanchor_13_97" id="FNanchor_13_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_97" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>With the appearance of <i>O Mulato</i>, 1881, by Aluizio
Azevedo (1857-1912), the literature of Brazil, prepared
for such a reorientation by the direct influence of the great
Portuguese, Eça de Queiroz and of Emile Zola, was definitely
steered toward naturalism. “In Aluizio Azevedo,”
says Benedicto Costa, “one finds neither the poetry
of José de Alencar, nor the delicacy,&mdash;I should even say,
archness,&mdash;of Macedo, nor the sentimental preciosity of
Taunay, nor the subtle irony of Machado de Assis. His
phrase is brittle, lacking lyricism, tenderness, dreaminess,
but it is dynamic, energetic, expressive, and, at times sensual
to the point of sweet delirium.”</p>

<p><i>O Mulato</i>, though it was the work of a youth in his
early twenties, has been acknowledged as a solid, well-constructed
example of Brazilian realism. There is a
note of humour, as well as a lesson in criticism, in the
author’s anecdote (told in his foreword to the fourth edition)
about the provincial editor who advised the youthful
author to give up writing and hire himself out on a
farm. This was all the notice he received from his native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
province, Maranhão. Yet Azevedo grew to be one of the
few Brazilian authors who supported himself by his pen.</p>

<p>Aluizio de Azevedo’s types (<i>O Cortiço</i>, <i>O Livro de
Uma Sogra</i>) are the opposite to Machado de Assis’s;
they are coarse, violent, terre-à-terre. They are not so
much a different Brazilian than we find in the poetry of
Bilac, as a lower stratum of that same intelligence and
physical blend.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Symbolism, even more than Parnassianism in Brazil,
was a matter of imitation, “in many cases,” as the truthful
Verissimo avers, “unintelligent. It most certainly
does not correspond to a movement of reaction, mystical,
sensualist, individualistic, socialistic, anarchistic and even
classic, as in Europe,&mdash;to a movement, in short, which is
the result, on one side, of a revolt against the social organization,
proved incapable of satisfying legitimate aspirations
and needs of the individual, and on the other, of the
exhaustion of Naturalism and Parnassianism.” In poetry,
the school itself centres in Brazil about the personality
of Cruz e Souza, an African with a keen sense of the
racial injustice visited upon him, and with a pride that
could not stifle his outcries. He is often incorrect, and it
is true that carping scrutiny could find ample fare in his
verses, but they are saved by a creative sincerity.</p>

<p>It takes but a superficial knowledge of French Symbolism
to see how far are such poets as Cruz e Souza
and B. Lopez from their Gallic brethren. Insert Cruz e
Souza’s verses, without their author’s name, among the
clamorous output of the Romantics that preceded him,
and see how difficult it is to single many of them out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
any qualities that distinguish them as technique or matter.
The African was a spontaneous rather than an erudite
spirit. Verissimo does not even believe that he was conscious
of his gifts. And if, at any time, he pretended to
possess a special theory of esthetics, the noted critic
would have it that the poet’s well-meaning but ill-advised
friends instigated him. He was a “good, sentimental,
ignorant” soul “whose shocks against the social ambient
resulted in poetry.” De Carvalho holds a higher opinion:
“He introduced into our letters that <i>horror of concrete
form</i> of which the great Goethe was already complaining
at the close of the eighteenth century. And such a service,
in all truth, was not small in a country where poetry
flows more from the finger-tips than from the heart.”</p>

<p>Verissimo, indeed, does Cruz e Souza something less
than justice. In his short life (1863-1898) the ardent
Negro poet succeeded in stamping the impress of his
personality upon his age and, for that matter, upon
Brazilian letters. He is incorrect, obscure, voluble,&mdash;but
he is contagiously sincere and transmits an impression
of fiery exaltation. His stature will grow, rather than
diminish with time. Bernadim do Costa Lopez (1851-1916)
began as a bucolic Romanticist (in <i>Chromos</i>),
later veering to a Parnassianism (in <i>Hellenos</i>) that contained
less art than imitative artifice.</p>

<p>Among the outstanding spirits of the later poets are
the mystical Emilio de Menezes and the serenely simple
Mario Pederneiras. The latter (1868-1915) seems to
have undergone the influence of Francis Jammes; he is
one of the few Brazilians who acquired ease in the
manipulation of free verse. Emilio de Menezes, who
like Machado de Assis has translated Poe’s <i>The Raven</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
is best known for his remarkable trio of religious sonnets
grouped under the title <i>Os Tres Olhares de Maria</i> (The
Three Glances of Mary).<a name="FNanchor_14_98" id="FNanchor_14_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_98" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Later developments in Brazil, as in Spanish America,
reveal no definite tendencies that may be grouped
under any particular “ism.” Rampant individualism precludes
the schools of literary memory. Aranha’s <i>Chanaan</i>
directed attention to the Brazilian melting-pot.
One result of the recent war has been, in Brazil,
to strengthen the national spirit, and in
São Paulo, particularly, a young group headed
by the industrious Monteiro Lobato seems to
show a partial return to regionalism. The directing
inspiration for the more clearly regionalistic art came perhaps
from Euclydes da Cunha, whose Sertões brought so
poignant a realization that Brazil lived in the interior
as well as on the coast. As a corollary of the aspiration
toward national intellectual autonomy, there is setting in
a reaction against France, in favour of national, even
local types and themes. The literary product, if not at
its highest, is upon a respectable level. The novel is
ably represented by Coelho Netto,<a name="FNanchor_15_99" id="FNanchor_15_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_99" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> while the drama, not
so fortunate, plods along a routine path with such purveyors
as Claudio de Souza in the lead. To the São
Paulo group I look for the early emergence of some
worth-while talents,&mdash;young men of culture and vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
who will bring to Brazil not merely the plethora of poesy
that gluts her eyes and ears, but a firm grasp upon the
prose that is the other half of life. Romero, years ago,
said that what Brazil needed more than anything else was
a regimen for its daily life. Only yesterday, Lobato, in
his <i>Problema Vital</i>, studied the problem of what he calls
the ailment of an entire country, seeking first of all to
convince the nation that it was ill. And his initial prescription,
like that of Romero, calls for a national hygiene.
To this purpose he subordinates his activities as
littérateur.</p>

<p>Thus conditions, though not so bad as when Verissimo
studied his problem of the Brazilian writer some
thirty years ago, are still analagous. He found the literature
of his country, at that time, an unoriginal, pupil-literature,
often misunderstanding its masters, yet endowed
with certain undisputed points of originality.
“The Brazilian writer, in his vast majority of cases,
does not learn to write; he learns while writing. And
it is doubtless useful to him as well as to our letters that
the critic, at times, should turn instructor. The lack of
a public interested in literary life, and capable of intelligent
choice among works and authors, makes this secondary
function of criticism even more necessary and
serviceable.…”</p>

<p>Brazilian literature, as is highly evident, is not one of
the major divisions of world letters. It lacks continuity,
it is too largely derivative, too poor in masterpieces.
Yet today, more at least than when Wolf wrote
so enthusiastically in 1863, it is true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> “Brazilian
literature may justly claim consideration as being really
national; in this quality it has its place assigned in the
ensemble of the literatures of the civilized world; finally,
and above all in its most recent period, it has developed
in all directions, and has produced in the principal
genres works worthy the attention of all friends of
letters.”</p>

<p>The finest fruits of a national literature are the salient
personalities who cross all frontiers and achieve
such a measure of universality as is attainable in this
best and worst of all possible worlds. As the region
nurtures the national letters, so the national nurtures the
international. And this internationality is but the most
expansive phase of the individual in whom all art begins
and in whom all art seeks its goal. For art begins and
ends in the individual. A few such personalities Brazil
has already produced, notably in the criticism of José
Verissimo, the prose of Machado de Assis, the intellectuality
of Oliveira Lima, the poetry of Olavo Bilac.
They are valuable contributions to Goethe’s idea of a
<i>Weltliteratur</i>. Such as they, rather than a roster of
“isms,” “ists” and “ologies,” justify the study of the
milieu and the tradition that helped to produce them.
But precisely because they triumph over the milieu, because
they shape it rather than are shaped by it, do they
rise above the academic confines into that small library
whose shelves know only one classification: significant
personality.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br />
<span class="smaller">CASTRO ALVES</span></h2>

<p>During the last half of the month of February,
1868, two admirable letters were exchanged by
a pair of notable men, in which both discerned
the budding fame of a twenty-year-old poet. The two
notables were José de Alencar, chief novelist of the “Indianist”
school, and Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis,
not yet at the height of his career. The poet was
Castro Alves. His real “discoverer” was the first of
these two authors, who sent him from Tijuca to Machado
de Assis at Rio de Janeiro. In his letter of the 18th of
February, José de Alencar wrote (I quote only salient
passages):</p>

<p>“Yesterday I received a visit from a poet.</p>

<p>“Rio de Janeiro does not yet know him; in a very
short while all Brazil will know him. It is understood,
of course, that I speak of that Brazil which feels; with
the heart and not with the rest.</p>

<p>“Sr. Castro Alves is a guest of this great city, for but
a few days. He is going to São Paulo to finish the
course that he began at Olinda.</p>

<p>“He was born in Bahia, the region of so many excellent
talents; the Brazilian Athens that does not weary of
producing statesmen, orators, poets and warriors.</p>

<p>“I might add that he is the son of a noted physician.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
But why? The genealogy of poets begins with their first
poem. And what is the value of parchments compared
with these divine seals?…</p>

<p>“Sr. Castro Alves recalled that I had formerly written
for the theatre. Appraising altogether too highly my
experience in this difficult branch of literature, he wished
to read me a drama, the first fruits of his talent.</p>

<p>“This production has already weathered the test of
competent audiences upon the stage.…</p>

<p>“<i>Gonzaga</i> is the title of the drama, which we read in
a short time. The plot, centered about the revolutionary
attempt at Minas,&mdash;a great source of historical poetry
as yet little exploited,&mdash;has been enriched by the
author with episodes of keen interest.</p>

<p>“Sr. Castro Alves is a disciple of Victor Hugo, in the
architecture of the drama, as in the coloring of the idea.
The poem belongs to the same ideal school; the style has
the same brilliant touches.</p>

<p>“To imitate Victor Hugo is given only to capable intelligences.
The Titan of literature possesses a palette
that in the hands of a mediocre colorist barely produces
splotches.…</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, beneath this imitation of a sublime
model is evidenced an original inspiration that will later
form the literary individuality of the author. His work
throbs with the powerful sentiment of nationality, that
soul of the fatherland which makes great poets as it
makes great citizens.…</p>

<p>“After the reading of his drama, Sr. Castro Alves
recited for me some of his verses. <i>A Cascata de Paulo
Affonso</i>, <i>As duas ilhas</i> and <i>A visão dos mortos</i> do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
yield to the excellent examples of this genre in the Portuguese
tongue.…</p>

<p>“Be the Virgil to this young Dante; lead him through
the untrodden ways over which one travels to disillusionment,
indifference and at length to glory,&mdash;the three
vast circles of the <i>divine comedy</i> of talent.”</p>

<p>The reply from Machado de Assis came eleven days
later. He found the newcomer quite as original as José
de Alencar had made him out to be. Castro Alves possessed
a genuine “literary vocation, full of life and vigour
and revealing in the magnificence of the present the promise
of the future. I found an original poet. The evil
of our contemporary poetry is that it is imitative&mdash;in
speech, ideas, imagery.… Castro Alves’s muse has
her own manner. If it may be discerned that his school
is that of Victor Hugo, it is not because he copies him servilely,
but because a related temperament leads him to
prefer the poet of the <i>Orientales</i> to the poet of <i>Les Méditations</i>.
He is certainly not attracted to the soft, languishing
tints of the elegy; he prefers the live hues and
the vigorous lines of the ode.”</p>

<p>Machado de Assis found in the poet the explanation of
the dramatist. <i>Gonzaga</i>, to be sure, is no masterpiece
of the theatre, and Castro Alves quickly returned from
that interlude in his labours to the more potent appeal of
resounding verse. If he was fortunate, at the outset, to
find so influential a pair to introduce him into the literary
world, it was his merit alone that won him early prominence.
Only a year ago, signalizing the commemoration
of the fifteenth anniversary of his death, Afranio
Peixoto prefaced the two splendid volumes of his complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
works&mdash;including much hitherto unpublished material&mdash;with
a short essay in which he calls Castro Alves
<i>O Maior Poeta Brasileiro</i> (The Greatest of Brazilian
Poets). Let the superlative pass. If it is not important
to criticism&mdash;and how many superlatives are?&mdash;it
shows the lasting esteem in which his countrymen hold
him. He is not only the poet of the slaves; to many, he
is the poet of the nation and a poet of humanity as well.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His talents appeared early; at the Gymnasio Bahiano,
by the time he was twelve&mdash;and this was already the mid-point
of his short life&mdash;he not only wrote his first verses,
but showed marked aptitude for painting. Long before
his twentieth year he had become the rival of Tobias
Barreto, the philosopher of Sergipe, not only in poetry,
it seems, but in theatrical intrigue that centred about
the persons of Adelaide do Amaral and Eugenia Camara.
While Barreto, the half-forgotten initiator of the
<i>condoreiro</i> style, led the admirers of the first, Eugenia
Camara exercised a powerful attraction over Castro
Alves, in whom she inspired his earliest lyrics. Perhaps
it was because of her that he aspired to the dramatic
eminence which he sought with <i>Gonzaga</i>, produced
on September 7, 1867, at the Theatro São João amidst
scenes of tumultuous success. It was directly after
this triumph that he came to José de Alencar. As we see
from that writer’s letter, the youth was intent upon continuing
his studies; in São Paulo he rose so quickly to
fame among the students, not alone for his verses but
for his gifted delivery of them and his natural eloquence,
that he was shortly hailed as the foremost Brazilian poet
of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>But unhappiness lay straight before him. His mistress
left him; on a hunt he accidentally shot his heel and
later had to go to Rio to have the foot amputated; the
first symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis appeared and,
in 1869, he returned to Bahia to prepare his <i>Espumas
Fluctuantes</i> for the press. Change of climate was of
temporary benefit; he went back to the capital to be received
in triumph; new loves replaced the old. He was
foredoomed, however, and during the next two years he
worked with the feverish haste of one who knows that
his end is near. He died on July 6, 1871.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the history of Brazilian poetry Castro Alves may be
regarded as a figure characterized by the more easily
recognized traits of romanticism plus the infiltration of
social ideas into the sentimental content. Some would
even discover in a few of his products the first signs
of the nascent Parnassianism in Brazil. Long before
Carvalho selected him as the chief exponent of social
themes in the romantic period, Verissimo had indicated
that Castro Alves was “our first social poet, the epic
writers excepted. He is the first to have devoted a considerable
part of his labours not to sentimental subjectivism,
which constitutes the greatest and the best part of
our poetry, but to singing or idealizing social feeling, fact
and aspiration.”</p>

<p>Hugo is his great god; … “nosso velho Hugo.&mdash;mestre
do mundo! Sol da eternidade!” he exclaims in
<i>Sub tegmine fagi</i>. “Our old Hugo. Master of the world!
Sun of eternity!” Alves, often even in his love poetry,
seems to orate from the mountain tops. “Let us draw
these curtains over us,” he sings in <i>Boa Noite</i> (Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Night); “they are the wings of the archangel of love.”
Or, in the <i>Adeus de Thereza</i>, if time passes by, it must be
“centuries of delirium, Divine pleasures … delights of
Elysium.…” His language, as often as not, is the
language of poetic fever; image clashes upon image; antithesis
runs rife; verses flow from him like lava
down the sides of a volcano. Nothing human seems
alien to his libertian fervour. He captures the Brazilian
imagination by giving its fondness for eloquence ideas to
feed upon.<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now he is singing the glories of the book
and education, now upbraiding the assassin of Lincoln,
now glorifying the rebel, now picturing the plight of the
wretched slaves in words that are for all the world like
a shower of sparks. In his quieter moments he can sing
love songs as tender as the cooing of any dove, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in <i>O Laco de fito</i>; he can indite the most graceful and
inviting of bucolics as in <i>Sub tegmine fagi</i>; and this softer
note is an integral part of his labours.</p>

<p>But what brought fame to Castro Alves was his civic,
social note. From Heine, to whom he is indebted for
something of his social aspiration, he took as epigraph
for his collection <i>Os Escravos</i>, a sentiment that reveals
his own high purpose. “Flowers, flowers! I would
crown my head with them for the fray. The lyre! Give
me, too, the lyre, that I may chant a song of war.…
Words like flaming stars that, falling, set fire to palaces
and bring light to hovels.… Words like glittering
arrows that shoot into the seventh heaven and strike
the imposture that has wormed into the holy of holies.…
I am all joy, all enthusiasm; I am the sword, I am
the flame!…” The quotation is almost a description
of Alves’s method. Once again, for the part of <i>Os Escravos</i>
that was published separately five years after his
death, we find an epigraph from Heine prefacing <i>A Cachoeira
de Paulo Affonso</i> (The Paulo Affonso Falls):
“I do not really know whether I shall have deserved that
some day a laurel should be placed upon my bier. Poetry,
however great be my love for it, has ever been for
me only a means consecrated to a holy end.… I have
never attached too great a value to the fame of my poems,
and it concerns me little whether they be praised or
blamed. It should be a sword that you place upon my
tomb, for I have been a brave soldier in the war of humanity’s
deliverance.” This, too, is a description of Castro
Alves. He was a sword rather than a lyre; certainly
his verse shows a far greater preoccupation with purpose
than with esthetic illumination, and just as certainly does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he fall far short of both Hugo and Heine in their frequent
triumph over whatever purpose they professed.</p>

<p>I am not sure that the Brazilians do not confuse their
admiration for Alves’s short life and its noble dedication
with the very variable quality of his poetry. Read
by one with no Latin blood in his veins it seems too often
a dazzling display of verbal pyrotechnics, freighted with
a few central slogans rather than any depth of idea. I
speak now of the work as a whole and not of the outstanding
poems, such as <i>As vozes da Africa</i> (Voices from
Africa), <i>O Navio Negreiro</i> (The Slave Ship), <i>Pedro
Ivo</i>. It is in these few exceptions that the poet will
live, but just as surely, it seems to me, will his esthetic
importance shrink to smaller proportions than the
national criticism today accords it. The ever-scrupulous,
ever-truthful Verissimo, who does not join the general
chorus of uncritical admiration of Castro Alves, indicates
that even his strongest claim upon us&mdash;that of a
singer of the slaves&mdash;is injured by an evident exaggeration.
What might be called Alves’s “Africanism” is
thus condemned of untruth to artistic as well as to quotidian
reality, in much the same manner as was the “Indianism”
in the poetry of Gonçalves Dias.…<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> “The
lack of objective reality offends us and our taste, habituated
as we are to the reality of life transported to artistic
representations. As I have already had occasion to observe,
Castro Alves’s defect as a poet of the slaves is that
he idealized the slave, removing him from reality, perhaps
in greater degree than art permits, making him
escape&mdash;which is evidently false&mdash;the inevitable degradation
of slavery. His slaves are Spartacuses or belong
to the gallery of Hugo’s <i>Burgaves</i>. Now, socially, slavery
is hateful chiefly because of its degrading influence
upon the human being reduced to it and by reaction upon
the society that supports it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Castro Alves prepared the <i>Espumas Fluctuantes</i>
for publication he already felt the hand of death upon
him. In the short foreword that he wrote for the book&mdash;in
a style that is poetry, though written as prose&mdash;he
compared his verses to the floating spume of the ocean,
whence the title of the book. “Oh spirits wandering
over the earth! O sails bellying over the main!…
You well know how ephemeral you are … passengers
swallowed in dark space, or into dark oblivion.…
And when&mdash;actors of the infinite&mdash;you disappear into
the wings of the abyss, what is left of you?… A wake
of spume … flowers lost amid the vast indifference of
the ocean.&mdash;A handful of verses … spume floating
upon the savage back of life!…”</p>

<p>This mood, this language, this outlook, are more than
half of the youngster that was Castro Alves. For the
most part he is not original, either in form or idea; the
majority of his verses seem to call for the rostrum and
the madly moved audience. Yet more than fifty years
after his death the numerous editions of his poems provide
that rostrum, and the majority of his literate countrymen
form that audience.</p>

<p>When his powers are at their highest, however, he
achieves the true Hugoesque touch, as, for example, in the
closing stanzas of the famous <i>Voices from Africa</i>, written
in São Paulo on June 11, 1868:</p>

<p>As Napoleon, before the pyramids, told his soldiers that
forty centuries gazed down upon them, so Alves, in the
opening poem of <i>Os Escravos</i> called <i>O Seculo</i> (The Century),
invoking the names of liberty’s heroes&mdash;Christ,
Carnaris, Byron, Kossuth, Juarez, the Gracchi, Franklin&mdash;told
the youth of his nation that from the heights of
the Andes, vaster than plains or pyramids, there gazed
down upon them “a thousand centuries.” Even in numbers
he is true to the high-flown conceits of the <i>condoreiro</i>
school; the raising of Napoleon’s forty to the young Brazilian’s
thousand is indicative of the febrile passion that
flamed in all his work. Castro Alves was a torch, not a
poem. When he beholds visions of a republic (as in
<i>Pedro Ivo</i>), man himself becomes a condor, and liberty,
like the poet’s truth, though crushed to earth will rise
again.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Não importa! A liberdade</div>
<div class="verse">E como a hydra, o Antheu.</div>

<p>This is not poetry that can be read for very long at
a time. It is not poetry to which one returns in quest of
mood, evocative beauty, or surrender to passion. It is
the poetry of eloquence, with all the grandeur of true eloquence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and with many of the lesser qualities of oratory
at its less inspiring level. Castro Alves, then, was hardly
a poet of the first order. He sang, in pleasant strains,
of love and longing; he whipped the nation’s conscience
with poems every line of which was a lash; some of his
verses rise like a pungent incense from the altars where
liberty’s fire is kept burning; he was a youthful soul responsive
to every noble impulse. But his passion is too
often spoiled by exaggeration,&mdash;the exaggeration of a
temperament as well as a school that borrowed chiefly the
externals of Hugo’s genius. Nor is it the exaggeration
of feeling; rather is it a forcing of idea and image, accent
and antithesis,&mdash;the failings of the orator who sees his
hearers before him and must have visible, audible token
of their assent.</p>

<p>So that, when all is said and done, the permanent contribution
of Alves to Brazilian poetry is small, consisting
of a few love poems, several passionate outcries on behalf
of a downtrodden race, and a group of stanzas variously
celebrating libertarian ideas. All the rest we can
forget in the intense appeal of the surviving lines. I
know that this does not agree with the current acceptation
of the poet in Brazil, where many look upon him as
the national poet, but one can only speak one’s honest
convictions. With reference to Castro Alves, I admire
the man in the poet more than the poet in the man.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_100" id="Footnote_1_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_100"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> “It has already been said,” writes Verissimo, “that the Latins
have no poetry, but rather eloquence; they confound sentimental emotion,
which is the predicate of poetry, with intellectual sensation, which
is the attribute of eloquence. There is in the poetry of the so-called
Latin peoples more rhetoric than spontaneity, more art than nature,
more artifice than simplicity. It is more erudite, more ‘laboured,’ more
intellectual, and for that reason less felt, less sincere, less ingenuous than
that of the Anglo-Saxon peoples, for example. I do not discuss this
notion. We Brazilians, who are scarcely half Latin, are highly sensitive,
I know, to poetic rhetoric,&mdash;which does not prevent us, however,
from being moved by the sentimentalism of poetry&mdash;though superficially&mdash;when
it comes in the simple form of popular lyrism and sings, as
that does, with its naïve rhetoric, the sensual passions of our amorous
ardor, which is characteristic of hybrids. Examples of this are Casimiro
de Abreu, Laurindo Rabello, Varella and Gonçalves Dias himself. When
the poets became refined, and wrapped their passion, real or feigned&mdash;and
in fact rather feigned than real&mdash;in the sightly and false externals
of the Parnassian rhetoric, bending all their efforts toward meticulous
perfection of form, rhyme, metre, sound, they ceased to move the people,
or impressed it only by the outer aspect of their perfect poems through
the sonority of their verses. For at bottom, what we prefer is form,
but form that is rhetorical and eloquent, or what seems to us such,&mdash;<i>palavrão</i>
(wordiness), emphasis, beautiful images.…”</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br />
<span class="smaller">JOAQUIM MARIA MACHADO DE ASSIS</span></h2>

<p>Had he been born in Europe and written, say,
in French, Machado de Assis would perhaps
be more than a name today&mdash;if he is that&mdash;to
persons outside of his native country. As it is, he has
become, but fourteen years after his death, so much a
classic that many of his countrymen who will soon gaze
upon his statue will surely have read scarcely a line of his
work. He was too human a spirit to be prisoned into a
narrow circle of exclusively national interests, whence the
cry from some critics that he was not a national creator;
on the other hand, his peculiar blend of melancholy
charm and bitter-sweet irony have been traced to the
mingling of different bloods that makes Brazil so fertile
a field for the study of miscegenation. His work, as we
all may read it, is, from the testimony of the few
who knew him intimately, a perfect mirror of the retiring
personality. His life and labours raised the letters
of his nation to a new dignity. Monuments to
such as he are monuments to the loftier aspirations of
those who raise them, for the great need no statues.</p>

<p>Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis was born in Rio
de Janeiro in 1839 and died there in 1908; he came of
poor parents and was early beset with difficulties, yet the
very nature of the work he was forced to take up brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
him into contact with the persons and the surroundings
that were to suggest his real career. As a typesetter he
met literature in the raw; at the meetings of literary men
and in the book shop of Paulo Brito he began to feel the
nature of his true calling. At twenty he commenced to
write with the indifference and the prolixity of the ’prentice
hand; comedies, tales, translations, poems&mdash;all was
grist that came to his literary mill. His talent, though
evident, was slow to develop; it could be seen that the
youth had a gift for understanding the inner workings
of the human soul and that by nature he was an ironist,
yet his poetry, especially, lacked fire&mdash;it came from the
head, not the heart. Take the man’s work as a whole,
for that matter, and the same observation holds generally
true. He is not of the sort that dissolves into ecstasies
before a wonderful sunset or rises to the empyrean on
the wings of song; for such self-abandonment he is too
critical, too self-conscious. In him, then, as a poet
we are not to seek for passion; in his tales we must not
hunt too eagerly for action; in his novels (let us call them
such) we are not to hope for adventure, intrigue, climax.
Machado de Assis is, as far as a man may be, sui generis,
a literary law unto himself. His best productions, which
range over thirty years of mature activity, reveal an
eclectic spirit in whom something of classic repose balances
his innate pessimism. It has been written of him
that he was “a man of half tints, of half words, of half
ideas, of half systems.…” Such an estimate, if it be
purged of any derogatory insinuations, is, on the whole,
just; if Machado de Assis seems to miss real greatness,
it is because of something inherently balanced in his
make-up; he is never himself carried away, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
neither are we. Yet he belongs to a company none too
numerous, and when Anatole France, some years ago, presided
at a meeting held in France to honour the noted
Brazilian, he must have appeared to more than one in
the audience as a peculiarly fitting symbol of the spirit
that informed the departed man’s work.<a name="FNanchor_1_104" id="FNanchor_1_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_104" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Not that Machado de Assis was an Anatole France,
as some would insinuate. But he was not unworthy of
that master’s companionship; his outlook was more circumscribed
than the Frenchman’s, as was his environment;
his garden, then, was smaller, but he cultivated it;
his glass was little, like that of another famous Frenchman,
but he drank out of his own glass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The poetry of Machado de Assis appears in four collections,
all of which go to make up a book of moderate
size. And, if the truth is to be told, their worth is about
as moderate as their size. If critics have found him, in
his verse, very correct and somewhat cold; if they have
pointed out that he lacked a vivid imagination, suffered
from a limited vocabulary, was indifferent to nature, and
thus deficient in description, they have but spoken what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is evident from a reading of the lines. This is not to
say that a poem here and there has not become part of
the national memory&mdash;as, for example, the well-known
<i>Circulo Vicioso</i> (Vicious Circle) and <i>Mosca Azul</i> (The
Blue Fly)&mdash;verses of a broadly moralistic significance
and of little originality. His <i>Chrysalides</i>, the first collection,
dates back to 1864; already his muse appears as
a lady desirous of tranquillity (and this at the age of
twenty-five!) while in the poem <i>Erro</i> he makes the telltale
declaration:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">Amei-te um dia</div>
<div class="verse">Com esse amor passageiro</div>
<div class="verse">Que nasce na phantasia</div>
<div class="verse">E não chega ao coração.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I loved you one day with that transient love which
is born in the imagination and does not reach the heart.”
There you have the type of love that appears in his poetry;
and there you have one of the reasons why the man
is so much more successful as a psychological ironist in
his novels than as a poet. Yet close study would show
that at times this tranquillity, far from being always the
absence of torment, is the result of neutralizing forces;
it is like the revolving disk of primary hues that seems
white in the rapidity of its whirling.</p>

<p>These early poems dwell upon such love; upon a
desire for justice, as revealed in his <i>Epitaphio do Mexico</i>
(Mexico’s Epitaph) and <i>Polonia</i> (Poland); upon an elegiac
note that seems statement rather than feeling.
“Like a pelican of love,” he writes in one of his poems
that recalls the famous image of de Musset,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> “I will rend
my breast and nurture my offspring with my own blood;
my offspring: desire, chimera, hope.…” But read
through the verses of <i>Chrysalides</i> and it is hard to find
where any red blood flows. The vocabulary is small,
the phrases are trite; his very muse is named <i>Musa
Consolatrix</i>, bringing solace rather than agitated emotion.</p>

<p><i>Phalenas</i> (Moths, 1870) is more varied; the collection
shows a sense of humour, a feeling for the exotic, as
in the quasi-Chinese poems, which are of a delicate pallor.
But there is little new in his admonitions to cull the flower
ere it fade, and his love poetry would insult a sensitive
maiden with its self-understanding substratum of commentary.
His reserve is simply too great to permit outbursts
and like the worshipper of whom he speaks in his
<i>Lagrimas de Cera</i>, he “did not shed a single tear. She
had faith, the flame to burn&mdash;but what she could not do
was weep.”<a name="FNanchor_2_105" id="FNanchor_2_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_105" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He is altogether too frequently the self-observer
rather than the self-giver; nor would this be
objectionable, if out of that autoscopy emerged something
vital and communicable to the introspective spirit
in us all. He can sing of seizing the flower ere it fades
away, yet how frequently does he himself seize it?
There is humour in the ninety-seven octaves of <i>Pallida
Elvira</i>,&mdash;a queer performance, indeed, in which a thin
comic vein blends imperfectly with a trite philosophic
plot. Romantic love, the satiety of Hector, the abandonment
of Elvira, the world-wanderings of the runaway,
his vain pursuit of glory and his return too late, to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a child left by the dead Elvira, the obduracy of grandfather
Antero; such is the scheme. Hector, thus cheated,
jumps into the sea, which he might well have done before
the poem began.</p>

<p>More successful is <i>Uma Oda de Anacreonte</i>, a one-act
play in verse, in which is portrayed the power of money
over the sway of love. Cleon, confiding, amorous youth
that he is, is disillusioned by both love (Myrto) and
friendship (Lysias). There is a didactic tint to the
piece, which is informed with the author’s characteristic
irony, cynicism, brooding reflection and resigned acceptation.
Of truly dramatic value&mdash;and by that phrase I
mean not so much the conventional stageworthiness of
the drama’s technicians as a captivating reality born of
the people themselves&mdash;there is very little.</p>

<p>In <i>Americanas</i> (1875) the poet goes to the native
scenes and legends for inspiration; <i>Potyra</i>&mdash;recounting
the plight of a Christian captive who, rather than betray
her husband by wedding a Tamoyo chief, accepts
death at the heathen’s hands&mdash;is a cold, objective presentation,
unwarmed by figures of speech, not illuminated by
any inner light; <i>Niani</i>, a Guaycuru legend, is far better
stuff, more human, more vivid, in ballad style as opposed
to the halting blank verse of the former; for the most
part, the collection consists of external narrative&mdash;feeling,
insight, passion are sacrificed to arid reticence.</p>

<p>Thus <i>A Christã Nova</i> (The Converted Jewess) contains
few ideas; neither colour nor passion, vision nor
fire, inhere in it. There is a sentimental fondness for the
vanquished races&mdash;a note so common in the “Indian”
age of Brazilian letters, and in analogous writings of the
Spanish-Americans, as to have become a convention. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
poem tells the story of a converted Jewess who is betrothed
to a soldier. She is met by her betrothed after
the war, with her father in the toils of the Inquisition.
Rather than remain with her lover, she chooses to die
with her parent; father and daughter go to their end
together. Chiefly dry narrative, and perhaps better than
<i>Potyra</i>, though that is negative praise. The poem is
commendable for but two poetic cases: one, a very
successful <i>terza rima</i> version of the song of exile in the
Bible, “By the waters of Babylon sat we down and
wept …” and the other, a simple simile:</p>

</div>

<p>It is in the <i>Occidentaes</i> of 1900 that we find more of
the real Machado de Assis than in the series that preceded
it. The ripened man now speaks from a pulsing
heart. Not that any of these verses leap into flame, as
in the sonorous, incendiary strophes of Bilac, but at least
the thoughts live in the words that body them forth and
technical skill revels in its power. Here the essence of
his attitude toward life appears&mdash;that life which, rather
than death, is the corroding force, the universal and ubiquitous
element. The <i>Mosca Azul</i> is almost an epitome
of his outlook, revealing as it does his tender irony, his
human pity, his repressed sensuality, his feeling for form,
his disillusioned comprehension of illusions. His resigned
acceptance of life’s decline is characteristic of the man&mdash;part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
perhaps, of his balanced outlook. One misses in
him the rebel&mdash;the note that lends greatness to the hero
in his foreordained defeat, raising the drama of surrender
to the tragedy of the unconquered victim. But this
would be asking him to be some one else&mdash;an inartistic
request which we must withhold.</p>

<p>I give the <i>Mosca Azul</i> entire, because of its central
importance to the poetry of the man, as well as to that
more discerning outlook upon life which is to be found in
his prose works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>As one reads this, a fable comes to mind out of childhood
days. What is this poem of the fly, but the tale of
the man who killed the goose that laid the golden eggs,
retold in verses admirable for colour, freshness,&mdash;for
everything, indeed, except originality and feeling?
Those critics are right who find in Machado de Assis a
certain homiletic preoccupation; but he is never the
preacher, and his light is cast not upon narrow dogmas,
with which he had nothing to do, but upon the broad ethical
implications of every life that seeks to bring something
like order into the chaos we call existence,&mdash;a thing
without rhyme or reason, as he would have agreed, but
what would you? Every game has its rules, even
the game of hide and seek. And if rules are made to
be broken, part of the game is in the making of
them.</p>

<p>Companioning the search for roots of illusion is the
theme of eternal dissatisfaction. This Machado de
Assis has put into one of the most quoted of Brazilian
sonnets, which he calls <i>Circulo Vicioso</i> (Vicious Circle):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Bailando no ar, gemia inquieto vagalume:</div>
<div class="verse">&mdash;“Quem me dera que fosse aquella loura estrella</div>
<div class="verse">Que arde no eterno azul, como una eterna vela!”</div>
<div class="verse">Mas a estrella, fitando a lua, com ciume:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&mdash;“Pudesse eu copiar o transparente lume,</div>
<div class="verse">Que, de grega columna á gothica janella,</div>
<div class="verse">Contemplou, suspirosa, a fronte amada e bella!”</div>
<div class="verse">Mas a lua, fitando o sol, com azedume:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&mdash;“Misera! tivesse eu aquelle enorme, aquella</div>
<div class="verse">Claridade immortal, que toda a luz resume!”</div>
<div class="verse">Mas o sol, inclinando a rutila capella:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&mdash;“Pesa-me esta brilhante aureola de nume.…</div>
<div class="verse">Enfara-me esta azul e desmedida umbella.…</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Between the loss of illusion and eternal dissatisfaction
lies the luring desert of introspection; here men ask questions
that send back silence as the wisest answer, or words
that are more quiet than silence and about as informing.
The poet’s tribute to Arthur de Oliveira is really a description&mdash;particularly
in the closing lines&mdash;of himself.
“You will laugh, not with the ancient laughter, long and
powerful,&mdash;the laughter of an eternal friendly youth, but
with another, a bitter laughter, like the laughter of an
ailing god, who wearies of divinity and who, too, longs
for an end.…” This world-weariness runs all through
Machado de Assis; it is one of the mainsprings of his
remarkable prose works. It is no vain paradox to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that the real poet Machado de Assis is in his prose,
for in his prose alone do the fruits of his imagination
come to maturity; only in his better tales and the strange
books he called novels does his rare personality reach
a rounded fulfilment. Peculiarly enough, the man is in
his poetry, the artist in his prose. The one is as revelatory
of his ethical outlook as the other of his esthetic
intuitions. What he thinks, as distinct from
what he feels, is in his verse rather than in his novels
or tales.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He was haunted, it seems, by the symbol of a Prometheus
wearied of his immortality of anguish,&mdash;by the <i>tedium
vitae</i>. This world-weariness appears in the very
reticence of his style. He writes, at times, as if it were
one of the vanities of vanities, yet one feels that a certain
inner pride lay behind this outer timidity. His
method is the most leisurely of indirection,&mdash;not the involved
indirection of a Conrad, nor the circuitous adumbration
of a Hamsun. He has been compared, for his
humourism, to the Englishman Sterne, and there is a basis
for the comparison if we remove all connotation of ribaldry
and retain only the fruitful rambling. Machado
de Assis is the essence of charming sobriety, of slily smiling
half-speech. He is something like his own Ahasverus
in the conte <i>Viver!</i>, withdrawn from life not so much because
he hated it as because he loved it exceedingly.</p>

<p>In that admirable dialogue, wherein Prometheus appears
as a vision before the Wandering Jew, the tedium
of existence is compressed into a few brief pages.</p>

<p>We have come to the end of time and Ahasverus, seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
upon a rock, gazes for a long while upon the horizon,
athwart which wing two eagles, crossing each other in
their path. The day is waning.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ahasverus</span></p>

<p>I have come to the end of time; this is the threshold
of eternity. The earth is deserted; no other man
breathes the air of life. I am the last; I can die. Die!
Precious thought! For centuries I have lived, wearied,
mortified, wandering ever, but now the centuries are coming
to an end, and I shall die with them. Ancient nature,
farewell! Azure sky, clouds ever reborn, roses of
a day and of every day, perennial waters, hostile earth
that never would devour my bones, farewell! The eternal
wanderer will wander no longer. God may pardon
me if He wishes, but death will console me. That mountain
is as unyielding as my grief; those eagles that fly
yonder must be as famished as my despair.</p>

</div>

<p>Whereupon Prometheus appears and the two great
symbols of human suffering debate upon the life everlasting.
The crime of the Wandering Jew was great,
Prometheus admits, but his was a lenient punishment.
Other men read but a chapter of life, while Ahasverus
read the whole book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> “What does one chapter know of
the other? Nothing. But he who has read them all,
connects them and concludes. Are there melancholy
pages? There are merry and happy ones, too. Tragic
convulsion precedes that of laughter; life burgeons from
death; swans and swallows change climate, without ever
abandoning it entirely; and thus all is harmonized and
begun anew.” But Ahasverus, continuing the tale of his
wanderings, expresses the meaninglessness of immortality:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I left Jerusalem. I began my wandering through the
ages. I journeyed everywhere, whatever the race, the
creed, the tongue; suns and snows, barbarous and civilized
peoples, islands, continents; wherever a man
breathed, there breathed I. I never laboured. Labour
is a refuge, and that refuge was denied me. Every
morning I found upon me the necessary money for the
day.… See; this is the last apportionment. Go, for
I need you no longer. (<i>He draws forth the money and
throws it away.</i>) I did not work; I just journeyed, ever
and ever, one day after another, year after year unendingly,
century after century. Eternal justice knew what
it was doing: it added idleness to eternity. One generation
bequeathed me to the other. The languages, as
they died, preserved my name like a fossil. With the
passing of time all was forgotten; the heroes faded into
myths, into shadow, and history crumbled to fragments,
only two or three vague, remote characteristics remaining
to it. And I saw them in changing aspect. You
spoke of a chapter? Happy are those who read only
one chapter of life. Those who depart at the birth of
empires bear with them the impression of their perpetuity;
those who die at their fall, are buried in the hope
of their restoration; but do you not realize what it is to
see the same things unceasingly,&mdash;the same alternation
of prosperity and desolation, desolation and prosperity,
eternal obsequies and eternal halleluiahs, dawn upon
dawn, sunset upon sunset?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prometheus</span></p>

<p>But you did not suffer, I believe. It is something not
to suffer.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ahasverus</span></p>

<p>Yes, but I saw other men suffer, and in the end the
spectacle of joy gave me the same sensations as the discourses
of an idiot. Fatalities of flesh and blood, unending
strife,&mdash;I saw all pass before my eyes, until night
caused me to lose my taste for day, and now I cannot distinguish
flowers from thistles. Everything is confused
in my weary retina.</p>

</div>

<p>As Prometheus is but a vision, he is in reality identical
with Ahasverus; and as Ahasverus here speaks, according
to our interpretation, for Machado de Assis, so too
does Prometheus. Particularly when he utters such sentiments
as “The description of life is not worth the sensation
of life.” Yet in Machado de Assis, description and
sensation are fairly one; like so many ironists, he has a
mistrust of feeling. The close of the dialogue is a striking
commentary upon the retiring duality of the writer.
Ahasverus, in his vision, is loosening the fetters of Prometheus,
and the Greek addresses him:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Loosen them, new Hercules, last man of the old world, who
shall be the first of the new. Such is your destiny; neither you
nor I,&mdash;nobody can alter it. You go farther than your Moses.
From the top of Mount Nebo, at the point of death, he beheld
the land of Jericho, which was to belong to his descendants and
the Lord said unto him: “Thou hast seen with thine eyes, yet
shalt not pass beyond.” <i>You</i> shall pass beyond, Ahasverus; you
shall dwell in Jericho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ahasverus</span></p>

<p>Place your hand upon my head; look well at me; fill me with
the reality of your prediction; let me breathe a little of the new,
full life … King, did you say?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prometheus</span></p>

<p>The chosen king of a chosen people.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ahasverus</span></p>

<p>It is not too much in recompense for the deep ignominy in
which I have dwelt. Where one life heaped mire, another life
will place a halo. Speak, speak on … speak on … (<i>He
continues to dream. The two eagles draw near.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Eagle</span></p>

<p>Ay, ay, ay! Alas for this last man; he is dying, yet he dreams
of life.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Second Eagle</span></p>

<p>Not so much that he hated it as that he loved it so much.<a name="FNanchor_5_108" id="FNanchor_5_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_108" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So much for the weariness of the superhuman,&mdash;an
attitude matched among us more common mortals by
such a delirium as occurs in a famous passage of Machado
de Assis’s <i>Braz Cubas</i>, one of the mature works of
which <i>Dom Casmurro</i> is by many held to be the best.
What shall we say of the plots of these novels? In
reality, the plots do not exist. They are the slenderest
of strings upon which the master stylist hangs the pearls
of his wisdom. And such a wisdom! Not the maxims
of a Solomon, nor the pompous nothings of the professional
moralist. Seeming by-products of the narrative,
they form its essence. To read Machado de Assi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>s’s
central novels for their tale is the vainest of pursuits.
He is not interested in goals; the road is his pleasure, and
he pauses wherever he lists, indulging the most whimsical
conceits. For this Brazilian is a master of the whimsy
that is instinct with a sense of man’s futility.</p>

<p>Here, for example, is almost the whole of Chapter
XVII of <i>Dom Casmurro</i>. What has it to do with the
love story of the hero and Capitú? Nothing. It could
be removed, like any number of passages from Machado
de Assis’s chief labours, without destroying the mere tale.
Yet it is precisely these passages that are the soul of the
man’s work.</p>

<p>The chapter is entitled The Worms (<i>Os Vermes</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“ … When, later, I came to know that the lance
of Achilles also cured a wound that it inflicted, I conceived
certain desires to write a disquisition upon the subject.
I went as far as to approach old books, dead
books, buried books, to open them, compare them, plumbing
the text and the sense, so as to find the common
origin of pagan oracle and Israelite thought. I seized
upon the very worms of the books, that they might tell
me what there was in the texts they gnawed.</p>

<p>“‘My dear sir,’ replied a long, fat bookworm, ‘we
know absolutely nothing about the texts that we gnaw,
nor do we choose what we gnaw, nor do we love or detest
what we gnaw; we simply go on gnawing.’</p>

<p>“And that was all I got out of him. All the others,
as if they had agreed upon it, repeated the same song.
Perhaps this discreet silence upon the texts they gnawed
was itself another manner still of gnawing the gnawed.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is more than a commentary upon books; it is, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
little, a philosophical attitude toward life, and, so far
as one may judge from his works, it was Machado de
Assis’s attitude. He was a kindly sceptic; for that
matter, look through the history of scepticism, and see
whether, as a lot, the sceptics are not much more kindly
than their supposedly sweeter-tempered brothers who
dwell in the everlasting grace of life’s certainties.</p>

<p>Machado de Assis was not too hopeful of human
nature. One of his most noted tales, <i>O Infermeiro</i>
(The Nurse or Attendant) is a miniature masterpiece of
irony in which man’s self-deception in the face of his own
advantages is brought out with that charm-in-power which
is not the least of the Brazilian’s qualities.</p>

<p>A man has hired out as nurse to a testy old invalid,
who has changed one after the other all the attendants
he has engaged. The nurse seems more fortunate
than the rest, though matters rapidly approach a climax,
until “on the evening of the 24th of August the colonel
had a violent attack of anger; he struck me, he called me
the vilest names, he threatened to shoot me; finally he
threw in my face a plate of porridge that was too cold
for him. The plate struck the wall and broke into a
thousand fragments.</p>

<p>“‘You’ll pay me for it, you thief!’ he bellowed.</p>

<p>“For a long time he grumbled. Towards eleven o’clock
he gradually fell asleep. While he slept I took a book
out of my pocket, a translation of an old d’Alancourt
novel which I had found lying about, and began to read it
in his room, at a small distance from his bed. I was to
wake him at midnight to give him his medicine; but,
whether it was due to fatigue or to the influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
book, I, too, before reaching the second page, fell asleep.
The cries of the colonel awoke me with a start; in an instant
I was up. He, apparently in a delirium, continued
to utter the same cries; finally he seized his water-bottle
and threw it at my face. I could not get out of the way
in time; the bottle hit me in the left cheek, and the pain
was so acute that I almost lost consciousness. With a
leap I rushed upon the invalid; I tightened my hands
around his neck; he struggled several moments; I
strangled him.</p>

<p>“When I beheld that he no longer breathed, I stepped
back in terror. I cried out; but nobody heard me.
Then, approaching the bed once more, I shook him so as
to bring him back to life. It was too late; the aneurism
had burst, and the colonel was dead. I went into the
adjoining room, and for two hours I did not dare to return.
It is impossible for me to express all that I felt
during that time. It was intense stupefaction, a kind of
vague and vacant delirium. It seemed to me that I saw
faces grinning on the walls; I heard muffled voices. The
cries of the victim, the cries uttered before the struggle
and during its wild moments continued to reverberate
within me, and the air, in whatever direction I turned,
seemed to shake with convulsions. Do not imagine that
I am inventing pictures or aiming at verbal style. I
swear to you that I heard distinctly voices that were crying
at me: ‘Murderer; Murderer!’”</p>

<p>By one of the many ironies of fate, however, the testy
colonel has left the attendant sole heir to his possessions;
for the invalid has felt genuine appreciation, despite the
anger to which he was subject. Note the effect upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
attendant, whose conscience at first has troubled him
acutely:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus, by a strange irony of fate, all the colonel’s
wealth came into my hands. At first I thought of refusing
the legacy. It seemed odious to take a sou of that
inheritance; it seemed worse than the reward of a hired
assassin. For three days this thought obsessed me; but
more and more I was thrust against this consideration:
that my refusal would not fail to awake suspicion. Finally
I settled upon a compromise; I would accept the inheritance
and would distribute it in small sums, secretly.</p>

<p>“This was not merely scruple on my part, it was also
the desire to redeem my crime by virtuous deeds; and it
seemed the only way to recover my peace of mind and
feel that the accounts were straight.”</p>

</div>

<p>But possession is sweet, and before long the attendant
changes his mind.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Several months had elapsed, and the idea of distributing
the inheritance in charity and pious donations was by
no means so strong as it first had been; it even seemed
to me that this would be sheer affectation. I revised my
initial plan; I gave away several insignificant sums to the
poor; I presented the village church with a few new ornaments;
I gave several thousand francs to the Sacred
House of Mercy, etc. I did not forget to erect a monument
upon the colonel’s grave&mdash;a very simple monument,
all marble, the work of a Neapolitan sculptor who remained
at Rio until 1866, and who has since died, I believe,
in Paraguay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Years have gone by. My memory has become vague
and unreliable. Sometimes I think of the colonel, but
without feeling again the terrors of those early days. All
the doctors to whom I have described his afflictions have
been unanimous as regards the inevitable end in store
for the invalid, and were indeed surprised that he should
so long have resisted. It is just possible that I may have
involuntarily exaggerated the description of his various
symptoms; but the truth is that he was sure of sudden
death, even had this fatality not occurred.…</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my dear sir. If you deem these notes not
totally devoid of value reward me for them with a marble
tomb, and place there for my epitaph this variant
which I have made of the divine sermon on the mount:</p>

<p>“‘Blessed are they who possess, for they shall be consoled.’”</p>

</div>

<p>I have omitted mention of the earlier novels of
Machado de Assis because they belong to a romantic
epoch, and he was not of the stuff that makes real romantics.<a name="FNanchor_6_109" id="FNanchor_6_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_109" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
How could he be a genuine member of that school
when every trait of his retiring personality rebelled
against the abandonment to outspokenness implied in
membership? He is as wary of extremes, as mistrustful
of superlatives, as José Dias in <i>Dom Casmurro</i> is fond
of them. “I wiped my eyes,” relates the hero of that
book, when apprised of his mother’s illness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> “since of all
José Dias’s words, but a single one remained in my
heart: it was that <i>gravissimo</i>, (very serious). I saw
afterward that he had meant to say only <i>grave</i> (serious),
but the use of the superlative makes the mouth long,
and through love of a sonorous sentence José Dias had
increased my sadness. If you should find in this book
any words belonging to the same family, let me know,
gentle reader, that I may emend it in the second edition;
there is nothing uglier than giving very long feet to
very short ideas.” If anything, his method follows the
reverse order, that of giving short feet to long ideas. He
never strains a thought or a situation. If he is sad, it
is not the loud-mouthed melancholy of Byronic youth;
neither is he the blatant cynic. He does not wave his
hands and beat his breast in deep despair; he seems rather
to sit brooding&mdash;not too deeply, for that would imply
too great a concern with the silly world&mdash;by the banks of a
lake in which the reflection of the clouds paints fantastic
pictures upon the changing waters.</p>

<p>The real Machado de Assis stands apart from all
who have written prose in his country. Senhor Costa,
in his admirable book upon the Brazilian novel, has
sought to present his nation’s chief novelist by means
of an imagery drawn from Greek architecture; Aluizio
Azevedo thus becomes the Doric column; Machado de
Assis, the sober, elegant Ionian column; Graça Aranha,
the Corinthian and Coelho Netto the composite. Sobriety
and elegance are surely the outstanding qualities
of the noted writer. His art, according to Costa, is the
secret of <i>suggesting</i> thoughts; this is what I have called
his indirect method.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Machado de Assis belongs with the original writers
of the nineteenth century. His family is the family of
Renan and Anatole France; he is their younger brother,
but his features show the resemblance.</p>

the petals of a red, red rose. And she buzzed and flew, and flew and
buzzed, glittering in the light of the sun and the moon&mdash;brighter than
a gem of the Grand Mogul. A humble toiler saw her, and was struck
with amazement and sadness. A humble toiler, asking: “Fly, this glitter
that seems rather a dream, say, who taught it to you?” Then she, flying
around and about, replied: “I am life, I am the flower of grace, the

and closing his fist around it, smiled with contentment to think that he
held there an empire. He left for home. He arrives in excitement, examines
and his mute behaviour is that of a man about to dissect his illusion.
He dissected it, to such a point, and with such art, that the fly,
broken, repellent, succumbed; and at this there vanished that fantastic,
subtle vision. Today, when he passes, anointed with aloes and cardamom,

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br />
<span class="smaller">JOSÉ VERISSIMO</span></h2>

<p>It was a favourite attitude of Verissimo’s to treat of
the author as the author appears in his work, rather
than as he may be constructed from his biography
and his milieu. Some of the national critics have referred
to this as if it were a defect; it is, on the contrary, in consonance
with the finest work now done in contemporary
esthetic criticism and places Verissimo, in my opinion, at
the head of all critics who have treated in Brazil of Brazilian
letters. It is in precisely such a spirit that I shall
try to present him to an alien audience,&mdash;doubly alien,
shall I say?&mdash;in that criticism itself, wherever practised,
is quite alien to the surroundings in which it is produced.
Verissimo was what the Spaniards call a <i>raro</i>; he was as
little Brazilian, in any restrictive sense, as was Machado
de Assis. A conscientious reading of the thousands of
pages he left fails to reveal anything like a hard and fast
formula for literary appreciation. He was an intellectual
freeman, truly in a spiritual sense a citizen of the
world. In a country where even the more immediately
rewarded types of creative endeavour were produced
under the most adverse conditions, he exercised the least
rewarded of literary professions; in a nation where the
intellectual oligarchy was so small that every writer could
have known his fellow scribe,&mdash;where the very language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
betrays one into the empty compliment and a meaningless
grandiloquence,&mdash;he served, and served with admirable
scruple, gentility and wisdom, the cause of truth and
beauty. His manner is, with rare interludes of righteous
indignation, generally serene; his approach is first of all
esthetic, with a certain allowance for social idealism that
never degenerates into hollow optimism; his language,
which certain Brazilian have seen fit to criticize for lack
of stylistic amenities, is to one foreigner, at least, a source
of constant charm for its simplicity, its directness, its
usually unlaboured lucidity.</p>

<p>And these various qualities seem but so many facets
of the man’s unostentatious personality. He was not,
like Sylvio Romero, a nature compelled, out of some seeming
inner necessity, to quarrel; his pages, indeed, are restful
even when most interesting and most alive with
suggestion and stimulating thought. His Portuguese,
surely, is not so beautiful as the Spanish of his twin-spirit
of Uruguay, José Enrique Rodó, but there is something
in both these men that places them apart from their
contemporaries who practised criticism. They were
truly modern in the better sense of that word; they
brought no sacrifices to the altar of novelty, of sensation,
of an unreasoned, wholesale dumping of the past. They
did not confuse modernity with up-to-date-ness; they did
not go into ecstasies for the sake of enthusiasm itself.
They would have been “modern” in any age, and perhaps
for that very reason a certain classic repose hovers
over their pages. Each knew his classics; each knew his
moderns. But I doubt whether either ever gave himself
much concern over these really futile distinctions,&mdash;futile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that is, when mouthed merely as hard and fast
differences, as if restless, “romantic” spirits did not
exist among the ancients, and as if, today, no serene
soul may dwell in his nook apart, watching the world roll
on. Such a serenity lives in the pages of the Uruguayan
and of the Brazilian; like all things born of human effort,
they will lose as the years roll on, but something of permanence
is there because Verissimo, like Rodó, possessed
the secret of seizing upon something universal in whatever
he choose to consider.</p>

<p>That Europe, with its ancient culture, its aristocratic
intellectual circles and its concentrated audiences, should
have produced great critics, is not, after all, so much to
be wondered at,&mdash;surely, hardly more to be marvelled
at than the emergence of the great playwright, the great
novelist. That the United States, in recent years, reveals
the promise of notable criticism, is somewhat more
a cause for congratulation in that here we lack&mdash;or up to
yesterday, lacked&mdash;inspiring intellectual leaders. But at
least we possessed the paraphernalia, the apparatus, the
national wealth. We had publishers, we had printing-presses,
we had a generally literate populace, whatever
the use to which the populace put those capabilities. Our
young writers did not have to seek publishers abroad,
whence alone could come likewise, literary consecration.
That a Rodó should arise in Spanish America&mdash;and more
than one notable critic had preceded him&mdash;or that a Verissimo
should appear in Brazil, is fairly a triumph of mind
over matter. It is true that such an event would have been
impossible without the influence&mdash;and the decided influence&mdash;of
European culture; but it is a triumph, none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the less. And it is the sort of triumph that comes from
the sacrifice of material boons to values less tangible, yet
more lasting. I do not mean that Verissimo went about
deploring the humble position of the artist and the true
critic in Brazil; I am a mite mistrustful of self-analytic
martyrs, of whom we are not exempt in these United
States. He exercised a deliberate choice. Much of his
work first appeared in the newspapers, and this alone
must stand as a tribute to the organs that printed his
critiques. For the rest, his life and labours serve to
prove that south of the Rio Grande, no less than north,
economic materialism and the life of the spirit are at everlasting
grips with each other, and that there are men
(again on both sides of that stream) who are masters
rather than slaves of the chattels they possess.</p>

<p>He was not religious (remember that I am treating
him as he treated his own subjects&mdash;as he is revealed in
his writings); he was not intensely emotional; he looked
love and death straight in the eyes, as much with curiosity
as with any inner or outer trembling before either.
He was, in his realm, what Machado de Assis was in his,&mdash;a
spirit of the Limbo, shall we say? His motto, if
he would have accepted the static connotation of mottoes,
might have been Horace’s <i>medio tutissimus ibis</i>, only that
he sought the middle path not so much through desire of
safety as out of a certain philosophical conviction. But
there again I use a word that does not harmonize with
Verissimo’s intellectual elasticity, for words are almost as
hard and cold as the type that prints them, while thoughts
rather resemble the air that takes them into space. And
Verissimo is especially sensible to this permanence-in-transiency.
“As to permanence,” he wrote in an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
essay on <i>Que é Literatura</i><a name="FNanchor_1_110" id="FNanchor_1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_110" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (What is Literature?),
“it might be said, in a sort of paradox, that it is precisely
the transitoriness of the emotion that makes a book of
lasting interest. It is an essential difference between
knowledge and emotion that the first is lasting and the
second transitory. A fact learned remains, is added to
the sum of our knowledge. We may forget it, but such
forgetting is not in the nature of things necessary, and
the truths that are contained in a book of science that we
have read join our permanent intellectual acquisitions.
The emotions are by very nature fleeting,&mdash;they are not,
like the facts we learn, added to and incorporated
into one another; they are a series of experiences that
change constantly. Within a few hours the emotion
aroused by the reading of a poem is extinguished; it cannot
endure. It may be renewed, by the re-reading of
the poem or by resorting to memory, and, if it be a
masterpiece, successive readings and recollection will not
blunt its power to move us.”</p>

<p>He commits himself to no definite esthetic system, thus
suggesting his affinities to the French impressionists and
to that Jules Lemaître whom he so much admired. “No
meio não está só a virtude, mas a verdade,” he writes;
“not only virtue, but truth, lies in the middle.” This,
as I have said, is not a wish for the Horatian safety of
the middle course, but rather an innate mistrust of extremes.
To the ancient apophthegm that there is nothing
new under the sun&mdash;and it would be just as true to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
say that there is nothing old under it, or that all things
under the sun are new&mdash;he composes a variant that might
well stand as the description of the best in our newer
criticism: “Nada ha de definitivo debaixo do Sol”;
“there is nothing definitive under the sun.” In United
States criticism there is a lapidary phrase to match it,
and from a spirit who, allowing for all the modifications
of time, space and temperament, is kin to Verissimo. I
refer to a brief sentence that occurs in the Introduction
to Ludwig Lewisohn’s <i>A Modern Book of Criticism</i>, in a
paragraph devoted to demonstrating the futility of absolute
standards, as represented in the important work of
Paul Elmer More.… “Calmly oblivious of the crumbling
of every absolute ever invented by man,” writes Mr.
Lewisohn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> “he (i. e., Mr. More) continues in his fierce
and growing isolation to assert that he knows what
human life ought to be and what kind of literature ought
to be permitted to express its character. That a form of
art or life exists and that it engages the whole hearts of
men makes little difference to him. He knows.… And
what does he know? Only, at bottom, his own temperamental
tastes and impulses which he seeks to rationalize
by an appeal to carefully selected and isolated tendencies
in art and thought. And, having rationalized them by an
artifice so fragile, he seeks to impose them upon the men
and the artists of his own day in the form of laws. I
know his reply so well. It is this, that if you abandon his
method, you sink into universal scepticism and undiscriminate
acceptance. The truth is that I believe far more
than he does. For I love beauty in all its forms and find
life tragic and worthy of my sympathy in every manifestation.
I need no hierarchical moral world for my
dwelling-place, because I desire neither to judge nor to
condemn. <i>Fixed standards are useless to him whose
central passion is to have men free.</i> Mr. More needs
them for the same inner reason&mdash;infinitely rarified and refined,
of course,&mdash;for which they are necessary to the inquisitor
and the militant patriot. He wants to damn heretics.…
I do not. His last refuge, like that of every
absolutist at bay, would be in the corporate judgment of
mankind. Yes, mankind has let the authoritarians impose
upon it only too often. But their day is nearly
over.…”<a name="FNanchor_2_111" id="FNanchor_2_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_111" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This is one of the most important passages in contemporary
United States criticism,&mdash;doubly so because
the men thus ranged against each other are both accomplished
scholars and thus rise to symbols of the inevitable
contest between the intellect that dominates the emotions
and the intellect that has discovered wisdom in guidance
rather than domination. Verissimo was no Lewisohn;
he possessed many of that critic’s signal qualities, but in
lesser degree. His language is not so instinct with human
warmth, his culture not so wide nor so deep, his
perceptions not so keen; but he belongs in company of
such rare spirits. He is as unusual amidst the welter of
verbose opinions that passes for criticism in Spanish and
Portuguese America as is Lewisohn amidst our own colder
but equally vapid and empty reviewers and as was Rodó
in the milieu that but half understood him. Neither
Rodó nor Verissimo, for that matter, had a firm grasp
upon the budding intellectual life of these States; each
died a trifle too early for the signs of hope that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
would have been happy to discern. As it is, they
possessed the somewhat stencilled view of the United
States as the country of the golden calf; a view none too
false, more’s the pity, but too “absolute” in the sense that
we have just seen discussed. There is, for all the truth
in Rodó’s famous <i>Ariel</i>, a certain half-concealed condescension
that might not have appeared were that essay
written today.<a name="FNanchor_3_112" id="FNanchor_3_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_112" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The younger Spanish Americans and
Brazilians who have come north to study at our universities
and to acquaint themselves with the newer phases of
our culture, have been quick to respond to such spirits as
Van Wyck Brooks, Henry L. Mencken, Ludwig Lewisohn,
Joel Elias Spingarn. During the next decade, as these
young men rise to power in their own intellectual world,
their books will doubtless reveal a different attitude toward
the attainments of their Northern neighbours,&mdash;unless&mdash;and
there is always that unless,&mdash;political happenings
should contort their views and our scant spiritual
population should once again suffer, as so often in the
past, for the misdoings of our diplomats.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>Verissimo, then, is the critic-artist. The drum-beat of
dogma that pounds over the pages of Sylvio Romero is
never heard in his lines. Though he holds that art is a
social function&mdash;a form indispensable to the existence
of society&mdash;he realizes its individual import, without
carrying his belief to the point of that mystifying esoterism
so beloved of certain latter-day poets and dramatists.</p>

<p>To him, criticism was an art, and, reduced to its essential
elements, is practised by any one who expresses an
opinion or a feeling concerning a work of art. His mind
was open to every wind of doctrine that blew, but this
was hospitality rather than indiscrimination. “Let us
not rebel against the new poetic tendencies,” he wrote in
a controversy with Medeiros e Albuquerque, “for we
must understand that they are all natural, the result of
poetry’s very evolution. Let us not, on the other hand,
accept them as universal and definitive. There is nothing
definitive under the sun.… Schools, tendencies,
fashions, pass. Poetry remains, invariable in its essence,
despite the diversity of its form.”</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that the conditions under which
he wrote prevented his work from attaining the heights
that often it suggests. His Brazil needed a teacher rather
than a critic,&mdash;a policeman of the arts, as it were,&mdash;and
he had to supply the deficiency. Perhaps it is one’s imagination
that detects in his lines a certain all-pervading
sadness,&mdash;a sadness that seems sister to serenity. Only
when stirred to just combat&mdash;as in his controversy with
Sylvio Romero&mdash;does he abandon his unruffled demeanour,
and ever here he is more restrained than Sylvio could
be in his moments of calm. Verissimo,&mdash;and again he
suggests Rodó for a similar quality,&mdash;is ever a mite melancholy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
His thought and its expression at their best are
like a beautiful landscape seen in the afterglow of sunset;
a sort of intellectual twilight, most natural to one
who found truth and virtue in the middle. Yet is there
much Truth and Virtue in Verissimo,&mdash;whoever that
lady and gentleman may be? He sought to bring no
eternal verities; his aim, like Rodó’s, was to instil rather
the love of truth than any specific truth itself. He is a
dispassionate analyst. Hence his tolerance (another
quality of the middle, it will be noted), his diffidence, his
sincerity. After Verissimo, Brazilian criticism is confronted
with new standards,&mdash;flexible, it is true, but all
the more exigent. As Machado de Assis belongs to the
company of Anatole France, so Verissimo belongs with
Lemaître. At a proper distance, to be sure, but within
the circle of the elect. He was not deceived by theories,
for he looked to the creation itself; neither was he deceived,
and for the same reason, by men and women.
By their works he knew them, as by his work we know
him. It was his attitude as much as his accomplishment
that made of him the national glory he has become. And
no little of that glory is his because his sincerity transcended
the narrower claims of nationalism,&mdash;a nationalism
in Brazil as elsewhere too often identical with
unthinking pride, puerile boastfulness and the notions
of whatever political party happens to be predominant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With Sylvio Romero he shares pre-eminence as the
foremost modern Brazilian critic of letters. A passing
glance at the controversy between these contrasting personalities
will bring out not only their divergent qualities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
but more than one sidelight on the problems of
Brazilian culture and literature. I give it as it may be
seen through Verissimo’s eyes, because I think that he
sums up the case with his characteristic sincerity and
modesty.</p>

<p>Romero’s notable work, <i>Historia da literatura brasileira</i>,
was first published, in two volumes, in the year
1888, and brought the history of the nation’s letters
down to the year 1870. A second edition appeared in
1902-3, revised by the author. It was upon the appearance
of this second edition that Verissimo estimated the
qualities of the work in terms that should meet with the
approval of all but the blindest of partisans. He noted
not only its value as research, its solid qualities, but its
contradictions, incoherencies and abuses of generalization
as well. He called it “one of the most original, or
at least personal, most suggestive, most copious (in opinions
and ideas), most interesting” of books and noted,
what the most superficial must note at once, the man’s
polemical temper. “The source of our literary history,”
he wrote, “is the Introduction by Varnhagen to his
<i>Florilegio</i> of Brazilian poetry (Lisbon 1850, I and II
vols., Madrid, 1853, III). It was he who laid in those
pages the corner stone of the still unfinished edifice of our
literature.… Wolf, Norberto Silva, Fernandes Pinheiro
and others merely followed his lead, and if they improved
upon him, it was according to his indications.
And, if not by its philosophic spirit and critical method,
Sylvio Romero’s <i>Historia</i> derives in its general design
from the <i>Introduction</i> or Varnhagen.…”</p>

<p>The review, short as it was, revealed Verissimo’s intellectual
contrast to Romero. He is calm, even, logical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
somewhat cold, clear, French,&mdash;while Romero is the
born fighter, impassioned, rambling, eager to embrace his
vast subject, crowding into his history a mass of names
and works wholly without pertinence to the field, lacking
in literary grace.</p>

<p>In 1906 Verissimo was obliged to take up the subject
once more, this time in less dispassionate terms, forced
into a distasteful controversy when further silence would
have been tantamount to cowardice. Romero, in that
year, published together with Sr. Dr. João Ribeiro, a
<i>Compendio de historia da literatura brazileira</i> in which
Verissimo was acrimoniously attacked, “not only in my
opinions as a critic, which does not offend me, nor in my
qualities as a writer, which it would be ridiculous to enter
the field and defend, but in my literary probity, which
compels me to this refutation.…</p>

<p>“Sylvio Romero cannot suffer&mdash;and this is a proof
of a certain moral inferiority&mdash;contradiction and criticism,
and must have unconditional admiration.…”
The voluminous historian was vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> “It is an absolutely
certain fact, and most easily verified, that in no
country, in no literature, has any author quoted himself
so much as (I do not say more than) Sylvio Romero.…
Despite the fact that there was never a break or
even a difference in our relations, which for my part I
prized and which he did not seem to disdain, I felt, despite
his praise and his verbal animation&mdash;that of a master
toward his pupil&mdash;that my poor literary production
contended with his and therefore, in short, I was not
agreeable to him. It was evident to me that there were
two things that my friend could not pardon me for: my
small esteem (small in relation to his) for Tobias Barreto
and my great appreciation for a writer whose highly
justified glory has for some time seemingly robbed the
great critic of sleep.”</p>

<p>“I continue to maintain,” wrote Verissimo, “and all the
documents support me, that Varnhagen was the father
of our literary history, principally of that history as it
is conceived and realized by Sylvio Romero in his <i>Historia
da literatura brazileira</i>, whose inspiration and economy
derive far more from the studies of Varnhagen than
from the generalizations … of Fernand Denis or
Norberto Silva … I know perfectly well … what
was accomplished before him by Norberto Silva and Fernand
Denis, Bouterwek and Sismondi, etc.… The
oldest of these writers is the German Bouterwek. But I
doubt whether Sylvio Romero ever read him. In fact
this author concerns himself only in passing fashion with
Brazilian literature.…” And in turn Verissimo takes
up the work of Denis, Silva and other predecessors of
Varnhagen, rectifying the position of the investigator
whose merits have been so unjustly slighted by the dogmatic
“Pontifex Maximus of Brazilian letters,” as
Romero was called by Eunapio Deiró.<a name="FNanchor_4_113" id="FNanchor_4_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_113" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“A disciple of the French through Sainte-Beuve and
Brunetière, and of the English through Macaulay,” says
Carvalho in his recent work upon Brazilian literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
“Verissimo was what might be called an objective critic.
Versed in many literatures, even erudite, he lacked, in
order to be a great writer, a finer taste for beautiful
things, and likewise, the spirit, or rather, the fineness of
understanding and sensibility. His <i>Historia da Literatura
Brazileira</i> which is, we will not say a perfect, but
an honest synthesis of our literary evolution, shows the
primordial defect of its method, which was that of seeking
the individual to the detriment of the milieu, the personal
work to the prejudice of the collective. Verissimo,
who possessed a direct observation that could appreciate
isolated values keenly, lacked on the other hand
a deep intuition of universal problems; he was content to
point them out in passing; he did not enter into them, he
circled prudently around them.…”<a name="FNanchor_5_114" id="FNanchor_5_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_114" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>What Carvalho points out as a defect I consider Verissimo’s
chief contribution to Brazilian criticism,&mdash;his
primary concern with the individual. True, this may
lessen his value as a literary historian, but it makes of
him one of the very few genuine esthetical critics that
have appeared on this side of the Atlantic. It renders
him easily superior to Romero and Carvalho, the latter
of whom is much indebted to both Verissimo and Romero,
as is every one who seeks to write of the nation’s letters.</p>

<p>Verissimo has put into a very short essay his general
outlook upon Brazilian literature. It is instinct with the
man’s honesty of outlook, his directness of statement,
his fidelity to fact, his dispassionate approach. For that
reason I translate it almost entire as the best short commentary
available. It is entitled <i>O Que Falta á Nossa
Literatura</i> (What Our Literature Lacks).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What I know of American literature&mdash;and in truth
it is very little&mdash;authorizes me to say that ours is perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the oldest of the continent.<a name="FNanchor_6_115" id="FNanchor_6_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_115" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> From the literary standpoint
our nationality seems to have preceded the other
American nations. It is clear that I am not here insisting
upon a strict question of date; it is possible that in
Mexico, and even in Peru,&mdash;I haven’t at hand the means
for verifying the facts,&mdash;some writers may have arisen
earlier than our own, poets necessarily. Chronology,
in literature, however, though of considerable importance,
cannot alone serve to establish priority. A literature
is a grouping, and cannot in fact exist through a
single poet or an isolated book, unless that poet or that
book resume in eminent degree the entire thought or
feeling of a people who is already in some manner conscious
of itself. This is the case of Homer, if that name
stands for an individual.</p>

<p>“Since the XVIIth century we reckon in our midst
poets and prosers. This would prove that the necessity
of reporting oneself, of defining oneself,&mdash;which creates
literature,&mdash;already existed amongst us, no sooner than
we were born. The work of Gabriel Soares may, and I
believe should, be excluded from a history of Brazilian
literature, because such a history can be only that of
literature published and known in its day,&mdash;literature
that could have influenced its time and those who came
after. But it comprises part of a history of the civilization,
thought and spiritual progress of Brazil, showing
how already in that century a native of the country,
sequestered upon his plantation in the sertão, not only
possessed sufficient culture to write of matters pertaining
to his country, but felt also the necessity of writing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
down. It is certain that he was inspired likewise by interest
and that his work is a memorial to the Sovereign,
seeking personal concessions. But, on account of the
thoroughness and the breadth with which it is done, and,
above all, because of the general, disinterested spirit in
which it is accomplished,&mdash;the variety of its aspects and
the national breath that animates it, it far exceeds the
nature of a simple memorial. In the same position are
the <i>Dialogues upon the Grandeurs of Brazil</i> and their
author, whoever he may be. Preoccupation with history
is the surest token of a reflective national consciousness.
This preoccupation awoke early in Brazil, and not only
as a means of information with which the religious orders
tried to instruct themselves concerning the lay of the
land and to glorify themselves by publishing their own
deeds, but also in this same more general, more disinterested
spirit. Frei Vicente do Salvador is thus early
a national historian and not a simple religious chronicler.</p>

<p>“Two things occur to produce this development in
Brazilian literary expression, at the very beginning of
civilization in this country: the vigor of literary expression
in Portugal and the Jesuit <i>collegios</i>. Whatever be
the value of Portuguese literature, it is beyond dispute
that no literature of the smaller peoples rivals it in
wealth and variety. When Brazil was discovered, only
a small part of Italy, France, Spain and Portugal possessed
a literary life. England was scarcely emerging
into it, with the predecessors of Shakespeare, who had
not yet been born and whose first works date from the
end of the century. Germany, from the literary standpoint,
did not exist.</p>

<p>“Portugal, for already a century, had possessed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
language solidly constructed and policed, and in this respect
the labor of Camões is incomparably less than that of
Dante. Portugal was in its golden age of literature,
which already possessed chroniclers such as Fernão Lopes,
novelists like Bernardim Ribeiro, historians like João de
Barros, dramatists like Gil Vicente, poets such as those
of the <i>cancioneiros</i> and a line of writers of all kinds
dating back to the fourteenth century. Despite the rusticity
of the people, Portugal, in the epoch of Brazil’s
colonization, is one of the four countries of Europe that
may be called intellectual. The identification of the
colony of Brazil with the mother-country seems to me
one of the expressive facts of our history, and this identification
rendered easy the influence of Portuguese spiritual
life upon a wild region, so that it was possible to
obtain results which, given other feelings between the
court and the colony, would not have been forthcoming.
Since gold was not at once discovered here, and those
mines that were discovered proved relatively few and
poor, Brazilian life soon took on, from Reconcavo to
Pernambuco, where it was first lived, and later in Rio
Janeiro and even&mdash;though less&mdash;in S. Vicente, a modest
manner,&mdash;what today we should call bourgeois,&mdash;more
favourable to literary expression, to the leisure needed
for writing, than the agitated, adventurous existence of
the colonizers of mine lands.</p>

<p>“The collegios of the Jesuits, established with higher
studies as early as the XVIth century, and later&mdash;in imitation
of them&mdash;the convents of the other religious orders,
infiltrating Latin culture into the still half-savage
colony, favoured the transmigration hither of the powerful
literary spirit of the metropolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Soon, then, perhaps sooner than any other American
nation, and certainly sooner than, for example, the largest
of them all, the United States, we had a literature,
the written expression of our collective thought and feeling.
Certainly this literature scarcely merits the name
of Brazilian as a regional designation. It is Portuguese
not only in tongue but in inspiration, sentiment, spirit.
There might perhaps already exist, as in the author of
the <i>Dialogos das grandezas</i> or in Gabriel Soares, a regional
sentiment, the love of the native soil, a taste for
its traits, but there was no national sentiment other
than the selfsame Portuguese national sentiment. Even
four centuries later, I hesitate to attribute to our literature
the qualification of Brazilian.… For I do not
know whether the existence of an entirely independent
literature is possible without an entirely independent
language as well. Language is the constituent element
of literatures, from the fact that it is itself the expression
of what there is most intimate, most individual, most
characteristic in a people. Only those peoples possess
a literature of their own who possess a language of their
own. In this sense, which seems to me the true one,
there is no Austrian literature or Swiss or Belgian literature,
despite the existence in those peoples of a high culture
and notable writers in all fields.<a name="FNanchor_7_116" id="FNanchor_7_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_116" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>“Therefore I consider Brazilian literature as a branch
of the Portuguese, to which from time to time it returns
by the ineluctable law of atavism, as we may see in the
imitations of the literary movements in Portugal, or better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
still, in the eagerness&mdash;today almost universal in our
writers&mdash;to write Portuguese purely, according to the
classic models of the mother literature. This branch,
upon which have been engrafted other elements, is already
distinguished from the central trunk by certain
characteristics, but not in a manner to prevent one from
seeing, at first glance, that it is the same tree slightly
modified by transplantation to other climes. It is possible
that new graftings and the prolonged influence of
milieu will tend to differentiate it even more, but so long
as the language shall remain the same, it will be little
more&mdash;as happens in the botanical families&mdash;than a
variety of the species.</p>

<p>“A variety, however, may be very interesting; it may
even be, in certain respects, more interesting than the
principal type, acquiring in time and space qualities that
raise it above the type. Brazilian literature, or at least
poetry, was already in the XVIIth century superior to
Portuguese. It is by no means patriotic presumption,
which I lack completely, to judge that, with the development
of Brazil, its probable politic and economic greatness
in the future will give to the literary expression of
its life supremacy over Portugal, whose historic rôle
seems over and which, from all appearances, will disappear
in an Iberic union. If this country of ours does
not come apart and split up into several others, each a
‘patria’ with a dialect of its own, we shall prove true
to the prophecies of Camões and Fr. Luiz de Souza, becoming
the legitimate heirs of Portugal’s language and
literature. If such a thing should happen, it would give
us an enormous moral superiority to the United States
and the Spanish-American nations, making of us the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
nation in America with a truly national language and
literature.</p>

<p>“But this literature of ours, which, as a branch of the
Portuguese already has existed for four centuries, possesses
neither perfect continuity, cohesion, nor the unity
of the great literatures,&mdash;of the Portuguese, for example.
The principal reason, to explain the phenomenon
in a single word, is that it depended ever, in its earliest
periods, rather upon Portugal and later upon Europe,
France especially, than upon Brazil itself. It always
lacked the principle of solidarity, which would seem to
reveal lack of national sentiment. It always has lacked
communicability,&mdash;that is, its writers, who were separated
by vast distances and extreme difficulty of communication,
remained strangers one to the other. And I
refer not to personal communication, which is of secondary
importance, but to intellectual communication that
is established through books. The various influences
that can be noted in all our important literary movements
are all external. What is called improperly the
Mineira School of the XVIIIth century, and the Maranhão
pléiade of the middle of this (the XIXth) received
their inspiration from Portugal, but did not transmit
it. As is said in military tactics, contact was never
established between the writers or between their intellects.</p>

<p>“This lack of contact continues today (Verissimo
wrote the essay toward the end of the XIXth century)
and is greater now than it was for example during the
Romantic period. There was always lacking the transmitting
element, the plastic mediator of national thought,
a people sufficiently cultured to be interested in that
thought, or, at least, ready to be influenced by it. In
the construction of a literature the people plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
simultaneously a passive and an active rôle: it is in the people that
the inspiration of poet and thinker has its source and its
goal. Neither the one nor the other can abstract himself,
for both form an integral part of the people. Perhaps
only during our Romantic period, from 1835 to
1860, may it be said that this condition of communicability
existed, limited to a tiny part of the country. The
sentiment of a new nation co-operated effectively in creating
for writers a sympathetic public, which felt instinctively
in their work an expression of that nationality.
Then we learned a great deal of French, some English
and Italian, a smattering of German and became intellectually
denationalized. A success such as that of
Macedo’s <i>Moreninha</i> is fairly inconceivable today. Success
in literature, as in clothing, comes ready made from
Paris.</p>

<p>“Do not take me for a nationalist, and less still, for
a nativist. I simply am verifying a fact with the same indifference
with which I should perform the same office
in the domains of geology. I am looking for the explanation
of a phenomenon; I believe I have found it, and I
present it.</p>

<p>“So that, from this standpoint, it may be said that it
was the development of our culture that prejudiced our
literary evolution. It seems a paradox, but it is simply
a truth. Defective and faulty as it was, that culture
was enough to reveal to our reading public the inferiority
of our writers, without any longer counterbalancing
this feeling by the patriotic ardor of the period
during which the nationality was being formed. The
general cultural deficiency of our writers of all sorts in
Brazil is, then, one of the defects of our literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Doing nothing but repeat servilely what is being done
abroad, without any originality of thought or form, without
ideas of their own, with immense gaps in their learning,
and no less defects of instruction that are today
common among men of medium culture in the countries
that we try to imitate and follow, we cannot compete
before our readers with what they receive from the foreign
countries at first hand, by offering them a similar
product at second.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<p>“In addition to study, culture, instruction, both general
and thorough, carried on in time and with plenty of
time, firm and substantial, our literature lacks at present
sincerity. The evident decadence of our poetry may
have no other cause. Compare, for example, the poetry
of the last ten or even fifteen years, with that produced
during the decade 1850-1860, by Gonçalves Dias, Casimiro
de Abreu, Alvares de Azevedo, Junqueira Freire,
Laurindo Rabello, and you will note that the sincerity
of emotion that overflowed the verses then is almost completely
lacking in today’s poetry. And in all our literary
labors, fiction, history, philosophy, criticism, it is
impossible for the careful reader not to discern the same
lack. Perhaps it is due to a lack of correlation between
milieu and writer.… To aggravate this, there was,
moreover, lack of ideas, lack of thought, which reduced
our poetry to a subjectivism from which exaggerated
fondness for form took emotion, the last quality that
remained to it; it reduced our fiction to a copy of the
French novel, which obstructed the existence of a dramatic
literature, which sterilized our philisophic, historic
and critical production. This lack, however, is a consequence
of our lack of culture and study, which do not
furnish to brains already for several reasons naturally
poor the necessary restoratives and tonics. And the
worst of it is that, judging from the direction in which
we are moving, this very culture, as deficient and incomplete
as it is, threatens to be extinguished in a widespread,
all-consuming, and, anyway you look at it, coarse
preoccupation with politics and finance.”<a name="FNanchor_8_117" id="FNanchor_8_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_117" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br />
<span class="smaller">OLAVO BILAC</span></h2>

<p>His full name was Olavo Braz Martins dos
Guimarães Bilac; he is one of the most popular
poets that Brazil has produced; his surroundings
and his person, like the poetry that brought him his
fame, were exquisite,&mdash;somewhat in the tradition of the
French dandies and the Ibero-American versifiers who
imitated them&mdash;yet in him the note was not overdone.
He passes, in the history of the national letters, for
one of the Parnassian leaders, yet he is one of their
most subjective spirits. Toward the end of his life, as
if the feelings that he had sought so long to dominate
in his poetry must at last find vent, he became a sort of
Socialist apostle, preaching the doctrine of education.
“Brazil’s malady,” he averred, “is, above all, illiteracy.”
And like so many of his creative compatriots, he set
patiently about constructing text-books for children.
In his early days he found inspiration in the Romantic
Gonçalves Dias and the Parnassian Alberto de Oliveira;
very soon, however, he attained to an idiom quite his
own which lies somewhat between the manner of these
two. “He is the poet of the city,” one critic has written,
“as Catullus was of Rome and as Apuleius was of Carthage.”
He has been compared, likewise, to Lucian of
Samosata. Most of all, however, he is the poet of perfumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
passion,&mdash;not the heavy, drugged perfumes of
D’Annunzio, which weigh down the votaries until they
suffer amidst their pleasures, but&mdash;and again like some
of his Spanish-American brothers in the other nations
of the continent&mdash;a faun in frock coat, sporting with
naiads in silk. Bilac has his ivory tower, but its doors
stand ajar to beauty of body and of emotion. His is
no withdrawal into the inner temple; his eyes are always
peering into the world from which he supposedly stands
aloof, and his heart follows them.</p>

<p>We are not to look to him, then, for either impersonality
or impassivity. Even when he wrote of the Iliad,
of Antony, of Carthage, he had his native Brazil in mind,
as he revealed in his final poems. “We never really had
a literature,” he said shortly before his death. “We
have imitations, copies, reflections. Where is the writer
that does not recall some foreigner,&mdash;where is the school
that we can really call our own?… There are, for the
rest, explanations of this fact. We are a people in process
of formation, in which divers ethnical elements are
struggling for supremacy. There can be no original literature
until this is formed.…”</p>

<p>Again: “We regulate ourselves by France. France
has no strife of schools now, neither have we; France
has some extravagant youths, so have we; it shows now
an even stronger tendency,&mdash;the humanitarian, and we
begin to write socialistic books.” He spoke of poets as
“the sonorous echo of Hugo’s verse, between heaven
and earth, to transmit to the gods the plaints of mortals,”
yet only in the end do any of his poems ring with
such an echo, and the plaints that rise from the poems
of Bilac that his countrymen most love are cries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
passion. “Art,” he said, as if to bely the greater part
of his own life’s work, and with something of repentance
in his words, “is not, as some ingenious visionaries
would have it, an assertion and a labor apart, without
filiation to the other preoccupations of existence.
All human concerns are interwoven and blend in an indissoluble
manner. The towers of gold and ivory in
which artists sequestered themselves, have toppled
over. The art of today is open and subject to all the
influences of the milieu and the epoch. In order to be
the most beautiful representation of life, it must hear
and preserve all the cries, all the complaints, all the
lamentations of the human flock. Only a madman or
a monstrous egoist … could live and labor by himself,
locked under seven keys within his dream, indifferent
to all that is happening outside in the vast field
where the passions strive and die, where ambition pants
and despair wails, where are being decided the destinies
of peoples and races.…”</p>

<p>This is, as we shall presently be in position to note,
fairly a recantation of his early poetic profession of
faith. Which is right,&mdash;the proclamative self-dedication
to Form and Style that stands at the beginning of his
<i>Poesias</i>, or this consecration to humanity? Both. For
at each stage of his career, Bilac was sincere and filled
with a vision; in art, for that matter, only insincerity
and inadequacy are ever wrong. And perhaps not in
art alone. M. Gsell, who lately wrote an altogether
delightful book made up of notes taken at Anatole
France’s retreat at Villa Saïd, quotes this little tale from
the master, who was reminded of it by a portrait of
Paolo Uccello in Vasari. “This is the painter,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
France, “whose wife gently reproached him with working
too slowly.</p>

<p>“‘I must have time,’ the artist said, ‘to establish the
perspective of my pictures.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, Paolo,’ the poor woman protested, ‘but you are
drawing for us the perspective of destitution and the
grave.’</p>

<p>“She was right,” commented France, “and he was not
wrong. The eternal conflict between the scruples of
the artist and harsh reality.”</p>

<p>Bilac’s seeming recantation at the end was the result
of just such a clash between artistry and harsh reality.
Had he chosen, in the beginning, to devote his poetic
gifts to humanity, he might have been remembered
longer as a man, but it is doubtful whether he would have
achieved his standing as an artist. And Brazil would
have been the poorer by a number of poems that have
doubtless enriched the emotional life of the nation. I
wonder whether, in his later days, Bilac did not in a manner
confuse art with social service. There are souls in
whom the human comedy kindles the fires of song; such
as they sing,&mdash;they do not theorize. Bilac was not one
of them. There was nothing to prevent his serving
humanity in any of the countless ways in which man may
be more than wolf to man. But he himself, as an artist,
was not fashioned to be a social force. He was the
born voluptuary.</p>

<p>“Art,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> “is the dome that crowns the edifice
of civilization: and only that people can have an art
which is already a people,&mdash;which has already emerged
triumphant from all the tests through which the character
of nationalities is purified and defined.…”
Here again, his practice excels his theory. There is in
him little Brazilianism, and even when he uses the native
suggestion, as in his brilliant <i>O Caçador de Esmeraldas</i>
(The Emerald-Hunter, an epic episode of the seventeenth-century
sertão) he is, as every poet should be,
first of all himself. “Perhaps in the year 2500 there
will exist diverse literatures in the vast territory now
comprising Brazil,” he prophesied, in disapproval of
that sectionalism in letters which several times has tried
to make a definite breach in the national literature. But
is not all literature psychologically sectional? If the
ambient is not filtered through the personality of the
individual, is the product worth much more as art than
a county report? In our own country, of late, there has
been much futile talk of Chicago literature and New
York literature, and other such really political chat.
“Isms” within “isms,” which make good “copy” for the
newspapers and magazines, and which, no doubt, may
have a certain sociological significance. But when you
or I pick up a book or a poem, what care we, after all,
for the land of its origin or even the life of its author,
except as both are revealed in the work? Was not one
of Bilac’s own final admonitions to his nation’s youth
to “Love your art above all things and have the courage,
which I lacked, to die of hunger rather than prostitute
your talent?” And “above all things” means above the
unessential intrusion of petty sectionalism, partisan aim,
political purpose, moral exhortation, national pride. I
have no quarrel, then, with Bilac’s hopes for a national
literature, with his aspirations for our common humanity.
But I am happy that he was content to leave that part
of him for public life rather than contriving to press it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
willy-nilly into the service of his only half Parnassian
muse.</p>

<p>Bilac was, on the whole, less a Parnassian than was
Francisca Julia. She transmuted her passion into cold,
yet appealing, symbols; Machado de Assis’s feelings do
not quite fill his glass to the brim; Olavo Bilac’s passion
overflows the banks of his verse. Yet he remained as
true as so warm a nature as his could be to the vows of
his <i>Profissão de Fe</i>, with its numerous exclamation points
that stand as visible refutation of his avowed formalism.
The very epigraph of the poem&mdash;and the poem
itself stands as epigraph to the collection that follows&mdash;is
taken from none other than that ardent soul, Victor
Hugo, with whom at first the very opponents of the
Romantic movement tried to maintain relations. So
true is it that we retain a little of all things that we reject.</p>

<p>Bilac’s would-be Parnassian <i>Profession of Faith</i>, beginning
thus inconsistently with a citation from the chief of
the Romantics (a citation, it may be added, that is not
all consistent with Hugo’s own characteristic labours) is
the herald of his own humanness. Let us now leave
the “isms” to those who love them, and seek in Bilac the
distinctive personality. His <i>Profissão de Fe</i> is a bit dandified,
snobbish, aloof, with a suggestion of a refined
sensuality that is fully borne in his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Poesias</i><a name="FNanchor_2_119" id="FNanchor_2_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_119" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> upon which Bilac’s fame rests constitute
but a book of average size, and consist of the following
divisions: <i>Panoplias</i> (Panoplies); <i>Via Lactea</i> (The
Milky Way); <i>Sarças de Fogo</i> (Fire-Brambles); <i>Alma
Inquieta</i> (Restless Soul); <i>As Viagens</i> (Voyages); <i>O
Caçador de Esmeraldas</i> (The Emerald-Hunter).</p>

<p>The inspiration of the panoplies derives as much from
the past as from the present; there is verbal coruscation
aplenty,&mdash;an admirable sense of colour, imagery, fertility,
symbol. Even when reading the Iliad, Bilac sees
in it chiefly a poem of love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mais que as armas, porém, mais que a batalha,</div>
<div class="verse">Mais que os incendios, brilha o amor que ateia</div>
<div class="verse">O odio e entre os povos a discordia espalha:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Esse amor que ora activa, ora asserena</div>
<div class="verse">A guerra, e o heroico Paris encadeia</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In <i>Delenda Carthago</i> there is the clash of rutilant arms
and the sense of war’s and glory’s vanity; this is the typical
motif of the voluptuary, whether of love or of battle.
It is not, however, the sorrowful conclusion of the philosopher
facing the inevitable,&mdash;“the path of glory leads
but to the grave.” Rather is it the weariness of the
prodded senses. Scipio, victorious, grows mute and sad,
and the tears run down his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">For, beholding in rapid descent,</div>
<div class="verse">Rolling into the abyss of oblivion and annihilation,</div>
<div class="verse">Men and traditions, reverses and victories,</div>
<div class="verse">Battles and trophies, six centuries of glory</div>

<div class="verse">That Rome, the powerful, the unvanquished, so strong in arms,</div>
<div class="verse">Would go perforce the selfsame way as Carthage.…</div>
<div class="verse">Nearby, the vague and noisy crackling</div>
<div class="verse">Of the conflagration, that still roared furiously on,</div>
<div class="verse">Rose like the sound of convulsive weeping.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps in <i>Via Lactea</i> that the book&mdash;and Bilac’s
art&mdash;reaches its apex. This is a veritable miniature milky
way of sonnet gems; all claims to objectivity and impersonality
have been forgotten in the man’s restrained, but
by no means repressed passion. His love is not the ivory-tower
vapouring of the youthful would-be Maeterlinckian
that infests verse in Spanish and Portuguese America;
it is of the earth, earthy. When he writes of his love he
mingles with the idea the thought of country, and when he
writes of his country it is often in terms of carnal passion.
Verissimo has noted the same phenomenon in some of
the poets that preceded Bilac and, of course, it is to be
verified repeatedly in the singers of every land; indeed,
is not Liberty always a woman, as our national coinage
proves for the millionth time, and when soldiers are
urged to fight and die <i>pro patria</i>, is it not a beautiful lady
that hovers over the fields and trenches? In these sonnets
he becomes the poet-chiseller of Hugo’s distich; into
a form that would seem to have lost all adaptability to
new manipulation he manages to pour something new,
something his own. There is, in his very attitude, a preoccupation
with form for its own sake that enables him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to employ the sonnet without loss of effect. His devotion
to the cameo-like structure is not absolute, however.
In none of these poems does one feel that he has
cramped his feelings in order to mortise quatrain into
tercet. When, as in <i>A Alvorada de Amor</i>, he feels the
need of greater room, he takes it.</p>

<p>He is the lover weeping over gladness:</p>

<p>So runs the song in his more reflective mood, which is
half objection and half meditation. There are other
moments, however, in <i>Alma Inquieta</i> when a similar passion
bursts out beyond control and when, in his pride of
virility, he rejects Paradise and rises superior to the Lord
Himself.</p>

<p>The sonnet that follows this in <i>Via Lactea</i> is notable
for its intermingling of love, country and <i>saudade</i>:</p>

<p><i>Sarças de Fogo</i>, as its name would imply, abandons the
restraint of <i>Via Lactea</i>. In <i>O Julgamento de Phryné</i>
beauty becomes not only its own excuse for being, but the
excuse for wrong as well. Phryne’s judges, confronted
with her unveiled beauty, tremble like lions before the
calm gaze of their tamer, and she appears before the multitude
“in the immortal triumph of Flesh and Beauty.”
In <i>Santania</i> a maiden’s desires rise powerfully to the
surface only to take flight in fright at their own daring.
<i>No Limiar de Morte</i> (On The Threshold of Death)
is the voluptuary’s <i>memento mori</i> after his <i>carpe diem</i>.
There is a touch of irony borrowed from Machado de
Assis in the closing tercets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">You, who loved and suffered, now turn your steps</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>This is impressed in far superior fashion by one of the
best sonnets Bilac ever wrote: <i>Sahara Vitae</i>. Here,
in the image of life’s desert, he conveys a haunting sense
of helpless futility such as one gets only rarely, from
such sonnets, say, as the great Shelleyan one, <i>Ozymandias
of Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>For the clearness of its imagery, for the perfect progress
of a symbol that is part and parcel of the poetry, this
might have come out of Dante. It is not often that
fourteen lines contain so complete, so devastating a commentary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Side by side with <i>Beijo Eterno</i> (Eternal Kiss)
it occurs in the <i>Poesias</i>, as if to reveal its relation as reverse
to the obverse of the poet’s voluptuousness. <i>Beijo
Eterno</i>, like <i>A Alvorada de Amor</i>, is one of the central
poems of Olavo Bilac. It is the linked sweetness of
Catullus long drawn out. It is the sensuous ardour of
the poet inundating all time and all space, while <i>Sahara
Vitae</i> is the languor that follows upon the fulfilment of
ardour. They are both as much a part of the poet as
the two sides are part of the coin. The first and last
of the ten stanzas of <i>Beijo Eterno</i> epitomize the Dionysiac
outburst; they are alike:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In less amorous mood he can sing a serenade&mdash;<i>A
Canção de Romeu</i>&mdash;(Romeo’s Song) to which any Juliet
might well open her window:</p>

</div>

<p>And if, in the closing piece of this section&mdash;<i>A Tentação
de Xenocrates</i>&mdash;(The Temptation of Xenocrates)
the courtesan’s charms seem more convincing than the resistance
of the victorious philosopher, it must be because
Bilac himself subtly sided with the temptress, and spoke
with her when she protested that she had vowed to tame
a man, not a stone. If, in the manner of the Freudians,
we are to look upon the poem as a wish that the poet
could on occasion show such scorn of feminine blandishments,
it is doubly interesting to note that, though the
moral victory lies with Xenocrates, the poet has willy-nilly
made the courtesan’s case the more sympathetic.
What, indeed, are the fruits of a philosophy that denies
the embraces of a Laïs?</p>

<p>Just as Olavo Bilac’s voluptuousness brings to him
inevitably thoughts of death, so does his cult of form
lead him at times to a sense of the essential uselessness
of all words and all forms. He has expressed this nowhere
so well as in the sonnet <i>Inania Verba</i> from the section
<i>Alma Inquieta</i>:</p>

<p>Alma Inquieta reaches its climax with <i>A Alvorada de
Amor</i> (The Dawn of Love). It is important enough to
be quoted in full, as one of the sincerest and most passionate
outbursts of the Brazilian muse, in which Olavo
Bilac’s countrymen find mirrored that sensual part of
themselves which is the product of climate, racial blend
and the Adam and Eve in all of us.</p>

proud, unrepentant sinner&mdash;it might be the amorous Don
Juan himself,&mdash;who “accepts the enormousness of the
punishment with the same countenance that he wore when
formerly he accepted the delight of transgression!” He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
no less sincere, doubtless, when in <i>Ultima Pagina</i> (Final
Page) he exclaims</p>

<p><i>Tedio</i> (Ennui) is the voluptuousness of Nirvana after
the voluptuousness of Dionysus; like all sinners, he comes
for rest to a church. “Oh, to cease dreaming of what
I cannot behold! To have my blood freeze and my flesh
turn cold! And, veiled in a crepuscular glow, let my
soul sleep without a desire,&mdash;ample, funereal, lugubrious,
empty as an abandoned cathedral!…”</p>

<p>The section <i>As Viagens</i> (Voyages) consists chiefly of
twelve admirable sonnets&mdash;a form in which Bilac’s blending
of intense feeling with artistic restraint seems as
much at home as any modern poet&mdash;ranging from the
first migration, through the Phoenicians, the Jews, Alexander,
Cæsar, the Barbarians, the Crusades, the Indies,
Brazil, the precursor of the airplane in Toledo, the
Pole, to Death, which is the end of all voyages. At the
risk of overemphasizing a point that has already been
made, I would quote the sonnet on Brazil:</p>

<p>What is this, indeed? Part of some ardent Song of
Songs? Note how the imagery is exclusively that of
burning passion. Brazil becomes a fascinating virgin
who falls to the fortunate discoverer. In that sonnet, I
should say, is concealed about one half the psychology
of the narrower patriotism.</p>

<p><i>O Caçador de Esmeraldas</i> is a splendid episode in
four parts, containing some forty-six sextets in all, filled
with movement, colour, pervading symbolism and a certain
patriotic pantheism. More than a mere search
for emeralds the poem recounts the good that man may
work even in the vile pursuit of precious stones,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
vanity of all material quest. For sheer artistry it ranks
with Bilac’s most successful accomplishments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“His inspiration,” wrote Verissimo, considering the
verse of Bilac, “is limited to a few poetic themes, all
treated with a virtuosity perhaps unparalleled amongst
us … but without an intensity of feeling corresponding
to the brilliancy of the form, which always is more important
in him. This is the characteristic defect of the
Parnassian esthetics, of which Sr. Bilac is our most illustrious
follower, and to which his poetic genius adjusted
itself perfectly and intimately.” I believe that Verissimo
was slightly misled by Bilac’s versified professions.
There is no doubt that Bilac’s temperament, as I have
tried to show, was eminently suited to some such orientation
as was sought by those Parnassians who understood
what they were about; there is as little doubt, in my
mind, that his feeling was intense, though not deep. He
may have spoken of the crystalline strophe and the
etcher’s needle&mdash;which, indeed, he often employed with
the utmost skill,&mdash;but there were moments when nothing
but huge marbles and the sculptor’s chisel would do. It
was with such material that he carved <i>A Alvorada de
Amor</i>. “If Sr. Machado de Assis was,” continues Verissimo,
“more than twenty years previous to Bilac, our
first artist-poet,&mdash;if other contemporaries or immediate
predecessors of Bilac also practised the Parnassian esthetics,
none did it with such manifest purpose, and, above
all with such triumphant skill.…”</p>

<p>I am not sure whether Verissimo is right in having
asked of Bilac a more contemporary concern with the
currents of poetry. The critic grants that Bilac is perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the most brilliant poet ever produced by his nation,
“but other virtues are lacking in him without which there
can be no truly great poet. I do not know but that I
am right in supposing that, conscious of his excellence, he
remained a stranger to the social, philosophical and esthetic
movement that is today everywhere renewing the
sources of poetry. And it is a great pity; for he was
amongst us perhaps one of the most capable of bringing
to our anaemic poetry the new blood which, with more
presumption than talent, some poets&mdash;or persons who
think themselves such&mdash;are trying to inject, without any
of the gifts that abound in him.”</p>

<p>Bilac, as we have seen, did, toward the end of his life,
become a more social spirit. But this was not necessary
to his pre-eminence as a poet. He was, superbly, himself.
Rather that he should have given us so freely of
the voluptuary that was in him&mdash;voluptuary of feeling,
of charm, of form, of language, of taste&mdash;than that, in
a mistaken attempt to be a “complete” man, he should
sprawl over the varied currents of the day and hour.
For it is far more certain that each current will find its
masterly spokesman in art, than that each artist will become
a masterly spokesman for all of the currents.</p>

<span class="smaller">EUCLYDES DA CUNHA</span></h2>

<p><i>Os Sertões</i>, which first appeared in 1902&mdash;a happy
year for Brazilian letters, since it witnessed the
publication of Graça Aranha’s <i>Chanaan</i> as
well&mdash;is one of the outstanding works of modern Portuguese
literature. At once it gave to its ill-fated author
a fame to which he never aspired. His name passed
from tongue to tongue, like that of some new Columbus
who with his investigation of the sertão had discovered
Brazil to the Brazilians. His labour quickened interest
in the interior, revealed a new source of legitimate
national inspiration and presented to countrymen a
strange work,&mdash;disturbing, illuminating, disordered, almost
a fictional forest, written in nervous, heavily-freighted
prose. Yet this is harsh truth itself, stranger
than the fiction of Coelho Netto, wilder than the poetry
of Graça Aranha, though instinct with the imagination
of the one and the beauty of the other. The highly
original work struck a deep echo in English letters
and if Englishmen have neglected to read Richard Cunninghame-Graham’s
remarkable book called <i>A Brazilian
Mystic: The Life and Miracles of Antonio Conselheiro</i>&mdash;a
book that would never have been written had
not Euclydes da Cunha toiled away in obscurity to produce
<i>Os Sertões</i>&mdash;it is their loss rather than their fault.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
It is a hurried and a harried world. Who, today, has
time for such beauty of thought and phrase as Richard
the wandering Scots sets down almost carelessly in his
books and then sends forth from the press with mildly
mocking humour for his prospective, but none too surely
anticipated readers? Yet it is not the least of Euclydes
da Cunha’s glories that he was the prime cause of Mr.
Cunninghame-Graham’s <i>A Brazilian Mystic</i>. Not a fault
of English readers, surely; but none the less their loss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The author of <i>Os Sertões</i> was born on January 20,
1866, in Santa Rita do Rio Negro, municipality of Cantagallo.
Losing his mother when he was three years
old, he went first to Theresopolis to an aunt, and thence,
after two years, to São Fidelis to another aunt, with
whom he remained until his first studies were completed.
His father retiring to Rio de Janeiro in 1876, Euclydes
was transported to the capital, where he attended in due
course the <i>collegios</i> called Victorio da Costa, Anglo-Brasileiro
and Aquino. Naturally, he went through his
baptism of verse, preparing a collection called <i>Ondas</i>
(Waves); since every Brazilian early suffers an attack
of this literary measles&mdash;it would be almost impolite not
to indite one’s obligatory number of sonnets&mdash;the notice
is without any importance to a man’s later career. It was
at the Escola Militar da Praia Vermelha, which he entered
at the age of twenty, that he laid the foundations of
his scientific studies, and it is the scientist in Euclydes da
Cunha that solidifies <i>Os Sertões</i>.</p>

<p>The man&mdash;as his mature prose testifies&mdash;was of nervous
temperament, and was led into one political scrape
after another. At the very beginning of his career, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
away by the propaganda of Benjamin Constant, he
committed an act of indiscipline against the Minister of
War which has become famous in the annals of Brazilian
politics, having required the benevolent intervention of
the Emperor.</p>

<p>His journalistic labours began in 1888; the following
year found him at the Escola Polytechnica of Rio de
Janeiro, finishing his course as an engineer, but the
proclamation of the Republic interrupted his studies and
he returned to the army.</p>

<p>The material for his famous book was gathered while
in the service of the important newspaper <i>Estado de São
Paulo</i>, for which he went into the wilds to report the
government campaign against the fractious inhabitants
of the sertão.</p>

<p>The campaign, as taught in the Brazilian schools,
marked another stage in the establishment, the consolidation,
of the Brazilian republic. It took place during
the presidency of Prudente de Moraes (1894-1898) and
brought within the folds of the new régime the rebellious
sertanejos, who had rallied round the leadership of Antonio
Vicente Mendes Maciel. Maciel was born circa
1835 in Ceará and had, since 1864, attracted attention
because of his strange religious notions, his queer garb, his
legendary personality. Accused of crime, he was vindicated
and went off toward the interior of Bahia, wandering
in every direction over the sertões and reaching, at
last, a tiny hamlet of Itapicuru, which he christened with
the name Bom Jesus (Good Jesus) on November 10,
1886. The Archbishop of Bahia objecting, Maciel was
ousted in 1887 as a preacher of subversive doctrines.
His followers accompanied him, however, to Canudos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
an old cattle ranch which, in 1890 was an abandoned site
with some fifty ramshackle ruins of cottages. Thither
came flocking an army of devotees and riff-raff, so that,
when Maciel resisted the government that was intent
upon collecting its taxes, he had a respectable number to
heed his cry of insurrection.</p>

<p>At first the new republic tried religious methods, sending
a Capuchin friar to win over the rebels to the Church
and the Law. The monk despaired. Then followed
four expeditions against the mystical Antonio; the first
in November of 1896, the second during December-January
of 1896-1897, the third during February and
March of 1897, the last from April to October
of the same year. “The sad chronicle of the tragedy
of Canudos, the most important civil war in the history of
the country,” concludes one popular text-book account,<a name="FNanchor_1_130" id="FNanchor_1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_130" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
“indicated the immediate necessity of the unification of
the country.… It revealed, furthermore, the great
resources of strength and virility among the sertanejos,
who, though conservative and little disposed to lend
themselves easily to novelty, possess none the less qualities
important to the development of the country, once
they are in fact bound to the national life.”</p>

<p>Euclydes da Cunha’s revelatory book opened the
doors of the Brazilian Academy of Letters to him in
1903. He produced other books, one on the eternal
question of Peru versus Bolivia, in which he sides with
Bolivia; he became known for his speeches. The end
of his life, which occurred through assassination on the
15th of August, 1909, was caused by a sexual snarl in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
which the corruptors of his domestic happiness added
crime to betrayal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The plan of <i>Os Sertões</i> is that of a scientific spirit at
the same time endowed with the many-faceted receptivity
of the poet. Before approaching the campaign of
Canudos itself, the author studies the land and the man
produced by it; he is here, indeed, as Verissimo early
indicated, the man of science, the geographer, the geologist,
the ethnographer; the man of thought, the
philosopher, the sociologist, the historian; the man of
feeling, the poet, the novelist, the artist who can see and
describe. But nowhere the sentimentalist. From one
standpoint, indeed, the book is a cold confirmation of the
very law against whose operative details the author protests:&mdash;“the
inevitable crushing of the weak races by the
strong.”</p>

<p>Though a sertanejo school of fiction had existed before
<i>Os Sertões</i>, the book brought to Brazilians a nearer,
more intimate conception of the inhabitants of those
hinterlands.</p>

<p>“The sertanejo,” writes the author in Chapter III of
the section devoted to the man of the sertão, “is first of
all a strong man. He does not possess the exhaustive
rachetism of the neurasthenic hybrids of the coast.</p>

<p>“His appearance, however, at first blush, reveals
the contrary. He lacks the impeccable plasticity, the
straightness, the highly correct structure of athletic
organisms.</p>

<p>“He is graceless, seemingly out of joint, crooked.
Hercules-Quasimodo, he reflects in his appearance the
typical ugliness of the weak. His loose gait, curved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
almost waddling and tortuous, suggests the manipulation
of unarticulated members. This impression is aggravated
by his normally abject posture, in a manifestation
of displeasure that gives him an appearance of
depressing humility. On foot, when standing still, he
invariably leans against the first door-post or wall that
he finds; on horseback, if he reins in the animal to exchange
a few words with a friend, he at once falls upon
one of the stirrups, resting upon the side of the saddle.
Jogging along, even at a rapid trot he never traces a
straight, firm line. He advances hastily in a characteristic
zig-zag, of which the meandering tracks of the
sertão seem to be the geometric pattern.…</p>

<p>“He is the everlastingly tired man.…</p>

<p>“Yet all this seeming weariness is an illusion.</p>

<p>“There is nothing more amazing than to see him disappear
all of a sudden.… It takes only the arising of
some incident that requires the unleashing of his dormant
energy. The man is transfigured.…”<a name="FNanchor_2_131" id="FNanchor_2_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_131" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p>And it is this same powerful denizen of the Brazilian
hinterlands that is a prey to the most primitive of superstitions,
so that it was an easy matter for his resistance
to a distant seat of government to become coupled in
his mind with a resurgence of Sebastianism as newly
incarnated in the person of Antonio Maciel.</p>

<p>“This feeling of uneasiness in regard to the new
government,” writes Cunninghame-Graham, “the mysticism
of the people as shown in the belief in the return to
earth of Dom Sebastian, and the fear that the government
meant the destruction of all religion, tended to
make the dwellers in the sertão especially susceptible to
any movement, religious or political alike, during the
time between the abdication of the Emperor and the firm
establishment of the new government. Out of the
depths of superstition and violence, Antonio Conselheiro
arose to plunge the whole sertão into an erethism
of religious mania and blood.”</p>

<p>As relatively late as 1837 the region had witnessed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
veritable orgy of sacrifice. A fanatic had mounted the
so-called <i>pedra bonita</i> (pretty stone) and preached the
coming of King Dom Sebastian, “he who fell at the field
of Alcazar-el-Kebir. He foretold that the stone would
be cut into steps; not cut with any earthly tools, but
smoothed away by the shedding of the blood of children.
Up these steps, so miraculously to be prepared, surrounded
by his guard of honour, dressed in armour, the
King, who had been dead three hundred years, should
ascend and come into his own again, reigning in Portugal
and in Brazil, and bountifully rewarding those who had
been faithful to him and by their faith contributed to his
disenchantment.… A multitude of women, all a prey
to the mysterious agitation … came through the
mountain passes, followed the trails through the virgin
forests and assembled to hear the word preached at the
wondrous pulpit made by no earthly hands. Unluckily
they brought their children with them. Then, roused
to a religious frenzy beyond belief, as they stood listening
to the words of the illuminated <i>cafuz</i> or <i>mamaluco</i>&mdash;for
history has not preserved his name&mdash;women strove with
one another who should be the first to offer up her child,
so that its blood should split the rock and form the sacred
stair, by which the King, the long lamented Dom
Sebastian, should ascend in glory, bringing back peace
and plenty upon earth.… A common-sense historian
(Cunninghame-Graham refers to Araripe Junior’s
<i>Reino Encantado</i>) says that for days the rocks ran
blood.…”</p>

<p>Further incident is unnecessary to a notion of the sertanejos’
mystic habit of mind and action. The Brazilian
government became in their eyes a rule of dogs, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
favourite phrase for the republic was <i>a lei do cão</i> (the
law of the dog). In the popular quatrains that Euclydes
da Cunha collected are found merged the hatred of the
sertanejos for the governing class of Brazil, their millenial
hope in Dom Sebastian and their faith in Antonio
surnamed Conselheiro (i. e., the Councillor) as the deliverer
from all evil.</p>

<p>Cunninghame-Graham, like Euclydes da Cunha, and
like the better of the Brazilian’s critics, feels a strong
sympathy for the man in whom the new hopes of the
sertanejos were centred. It is a sympathy, moreover,
born of the understanding without which all knowledge
is as fruit turned to ashes in the mouth. The Scot, like
the Brazilian, is a psychologist. “Antonio Conselheiro
himself did not so much rebel against authority as
against life, perhaps expecting from it more than it had
to give upon the spiritual side, not understanding that
a fine day, with health to enjoy it, is the most spiritual
of pleasures open to mankind,” he writes, in his amiable,
worldly-wise (and heavenly-wise) way. And later:
“When all is said, it is impossible not to sympathize to
some extent with the misguided sectaries, for all they
wanted was to live the life they had been accustomed to
and sing their litanies. Clearly Antonio Conselheiro
had no views on any subject under heaven outside his
own district. His dreams were fixed upon a better
world, and his chief care was to fit his followers for the
change that he believed was to take place soon.”</p>

<p>It is Verissimo, who, with his almost unerring insight,
extracts from his countryman’s book its central significance.
Here is a volume that is a remarkable commentary
upon the formation of all religions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> “without
excepting our own Christianity. In another milieu,
under other conditions, Antonio Conselheiro is a Christ,
a Mohammed, a Messiah, one of the many Mahdis,
creators of religions in that fecund soil of human belief
which is Asia. In the sertão, friends and enemies and
even the constituted authorities, hold him (i. e., Antonio
Maciel, the people’s councillor) as a good, honest, upright
man, despite the legend&mdash;and is it only a legend?&mdash;which
attributes to a tragic matricide his transformation
from a business man into a religious preacher, his life as
a saint and a missionary of the sertão.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I find that I have spoken as much of Cunninghame-Graham
as of the Brazilian in whom he found his most
important source; that is because the Scotsman’s book
is the best possible revelation in English of the remarkable
account given by Euclydes da Cunha.</p>

<p><i>Os Sertões</i> stands alone in the nation’s literature; we,
in ours, have no book to parallel it in spirit, purport or
accomplishment. Yet even today there are regions to
which a similar method might be applied, for Verissimo’s
words about Asia seem to cover the United States as well,&mdash;in
less degree, of course, but for our purpose with equal
patness. More, a close reading of the government’s application
of force to a situation that might have yielded to
less warlike methods,&mdash;or, at least, that might have been
managed without the necessity of the final massacre&mdash;could
teach something to all governmental departments
that are brought into contact with alien or extra-social
groups which must be incorporated into the national entity.
<i>Os Sertões</i> is the best answer to the young Brazilian
regionalists who have made the book a rallying-point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Here is a volume&mdash;and a thick, compact volume it is&mdash;dealing
in quasi-reportorial spirit with a brief incident in
the most hidden recesses of the national interior; it was
not written with belles-lettres in mind; it is strewn with
terms and processes of thought that baffle the ordinary
reader. Yet the man who composed it was a vibrant personality,
and whether knowingly or unwittingly, he made
the book a symbol,&mdash;a symbol of uncomprehending persecution,
of human fanaticism, of religious origins, of
man’s instinctive seeking after something higher. It is
true that the persecution was in part necessary, that the
aspect of fanaticism here revealed is most repugnant, that
the spectacle of religious origins does not flatter our
unctuous, supposedly civilized, superior souls. But it is
true, likewise, that we must gaze into such depths as
these to remind ourselves occasionally that we dwell in
these inferiors. Such is the wisdom of Euclydes da
Cunha, of Richard Cunninghame-Graham, of José Verissimo.</p>

<i>A Brazilian Mystic</i> (pages 17-18) “amongst plants and animals presents
its counterpart amongst mankind. The climate sees to it that only those
most fitted to resist it arrive at manhood, and the rude life they subsequently
lead has forged a race as hard as the Castilians, the Turks, the
Scythians of old, or as the Mexicans.
</p>
<p>
“No race in all America is better fitted to cope with the wilderness.
The sertanejo is emphatically what the French call ‘a male.’ His Indian
blood has given him endurance and a superhuman patience in adversity.
From his white forefathers he has derived intelligence, the love of individual
as opposed to general freedom inherent in the Latin races, good
manners, and a sound dose of self-respect. His tinge of negro blood,
although in the sertão it tends to disappear out of the race, at least in
outward characteristics, may perchance have given him whatever qualities
the African can claim. Far from demonstrative, he yet feels deeply;
never forgets a benefit, and cherishes an insult as if it were a pearl of
price, safe to revenge it when the season offers or when the enemy is off
his guard.
</p>
<p>
“Centaurs before the Lord, the sertanejos do not appear (almost alone
of horsemen) to have that pride in their appearance so noticeable in the
gaucho, the Mexican and in the Arabs of North Africa. Seated in his
short, curved saddle, a modification of the ‘recao’ used on the Pampas
of the Argentine, the sertanejo lounges, sticks his feet forward, and
rides, as goes the saying, all about his horse, using, of course, a single
rein, and the high hand all natural horsemen affect. Yet, when a bunch
of cattle break into a wild stampede, the man is suddenly transformed.
Then he sits upright as a lance, or, bending low over his horse’s neck,
flies at a break-neck pace, dashing through the thick scrub of the <i>caatingas</i>
in a way that must be seen to be believed. Menacing boughs
hang low and threaten him. He throws himself flat on the horse’s back
and passes under them. A tree stands in his way right in the middle of
his headlong career. If his horse, highly trained and bitted, fails to stop
in time, he slips off like a drop of water from a pane of glass at the last
moment, or if there is the smallest chance of passing on one side, lies low
along his horse’s flank after the fashion of an old-time Apache or Comanche
on the war-path.”</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br />
<span class="smaller">MANOEL DE OLIVEIRA LIMA</span></h2>

<p>Oliveira Lima belongs, more than to the
history of Brazilian letters, to the history of
Brazilian culture. He is an integral part of
that culture and his life, coincidentally, runs parallel with
the emergence of Brazil into an honoured position among
the nations of the world. Once, in a happy phrase, the
Swedish writer Goran Björkman, a corresponding member
of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, characterized
him aptly as “Brazil’s intellectual ambassador to the
world,” and the phrase has stuck because it so eminently
fitted the modest, indefatigable personality to whom it
was applied. In a sense Oliveira Lima has been, too,
the world’s intellectual ambassador to Brazil; he has
seen service literally in every corner of the globe,&mdash;in
Argentina as in the United States, in Japan as in France,
Belgium, Sweden and Germany. Wherever he has come
he has torn aside the dense veil of ignorance that has
hidden Brazil from the eyes of none too curious foreigners;
from wherever he has gone he has sent back
to his native land solidly written, well considered volumes
upon the civilization of the old world and the
new. In both the physical and the intellectual sense
he has been, largely, Brazil’s point of contact with the
rest of the world. And the nation has been most fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in that choice, for Manoel de Oliveira Lima,
most “undiplomatic” of diplomats, is the most human of
men. He is, in the least spectacular sense of the word,
an inspirer, not of words but of deeds. Trace his
itinerary during the past twenty-five years and it is a
miniature map of a double enlightenment. If diplomacy
is ever to achieve anything like genuine internationality,
it must travel some such path as this. And I dare say
that Senhor Oliveira Lima is one of the rare precursors
of just such a diplomacy. The example of his career
has helped to raise that office from one of sublimated
social hypocrisy to the dignity of lofty human intercourse.</p>

<p>Manoel de Oliveira Lima was born on December
25th, 1867, in the city of Recife, Pernambuco,&mdash;that state
of which Silveira Martins has strikingly declared that
the Brazilian gaucho&mdash;indomitable defender of the
nation’s frontiers&mdash;was simply a Pernambucan on horseback.
He was sent early to Portugal to complete his
education, becoming one of the favourite students of
the noted historian Oliveira Martins; at the age of
twenty-one he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
and Letters from the University of Lisbon and
set out, after a couple of years, upon his career of diplomacy,
into which he was initiated by Carvalho Borges
and the Baron de Itajubá.</p>

<p>“Oliveira Lima never wrote verses,” declared Salvador
de Mendonça once in a speech of welcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> “I
believe that, with the exception of the <i>Lusiads</i>, all poems
are to him like the <i>Colombo</i> of Porto Alegre to the
readers of our literature, an unknown land awaiting
some Columbus to discover it. Like an old philosopher
friend of mine, who doesn’t admit monologues or asides
in the theatre because only fools or persons threatened
with madness converse with themselves, so Oliveira
Lima finds it hardly natural for people to write in verse,
for the language of seers was never the spoken tongue.
His spirit is positive and direct; only curved lines are
lacking for him to be a geometer. His characteristic
trait is sincerity; he says only what he thinks is true,
and says it without beating about the bush, in the explicit
form of his conviction. I believe that he is but
a lukewarm admirer of music, and prefers, to the contemplation
of nature, the study of social phenomena
and the examination of the human beehive.”</p>

<p>For a Brazilian never to have written verses is indeed
almost a violation of the social code, and it may
be that Senhor Lima’s lukewarmness toward music helps
to explain a certain lack of musicality in his clear but
compact prose. But lack of poetic appreciation should
not be inferred from his friend’s lines; one has but to
go through one of Lima’s earliest and most solid works,
<i>Aspectos da Litteratura Colonial Brazileira</i>, to discover,
in this original contribution, a deep, unostentatious feeling
for those beautiful emotions we call poetry.</p>

<p>His literary career, as we have seen, is closely identified
with his numerous peregrinations. It opened with
a historical study of his birthplace: <i>Pernambuco, seu
Desenvolimento historica</i> (1894), followed two years
later by the <i>Aspectos</i>. Thereafter is pursued, rather
closely, the travels of Lima, resulting in <i>Nos Estados
Unidos</i> (1899), a work of uneven value upon the United
States, <i>No Japão</i>, (1903), a more mature volume upon
the land of the rising sun, countless speeches and series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of lectures delivered in the universities of both hemispheres&mdash;now
at the Sorbonne, now at the University of
Louvaine, at Harvard, Yale, Stanford University and
lesser institutions&mdash;and always upon his favourite theme:
the history of Brazilian and Latin-American culture.
Out of these lectures have arisen more than one of his
books, some of them originally delivered in English
and French; for Lima is an accomplished linguist, employing
English and French with ease and speaking German,
Italian and Spanish as well.</p>

<p>It is history that forms his main interest; even when
he makes a single attempt&mdash;and not a highly successful
one&mdash;at the drama, his <i>Secretario d’El Rey</i> (The
King’s Secretary, 1904) turns upon the historic figure
of Alexandre de Gusmão in the days of 1738. It is
worth while noting, as a commentary upon Lima’s unfanatic
patriotism, that he justly considers this work a
Brazilian drama, though the action takes place in Portugal.
For,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> “in the first place, our historic period anterior
to the Independence necessarily involves so intimate
a connection of the colony with the court that it is
almost impossible, treating of the one, to lose the other
from sight. Material communication and above all
moral relations established a sort of territorial continuity
between both sides of the Atlantic, which formed
a single fatherland. Besides, the action of the piece
could hardly have been made to take place in Brazil,
since the protagonist of the play, perhaps the most illustrious
Brazilian of the XVIIIth century, and one whose
personality merited, as few others, consecration
upon the stage, lived in Europe from his earliest youth.
For identical reasons the action of <i>O Poeta e a Inquisção</i>
(The Poet and the Inquisition) by Domingos de Magalhães,
our first national tragedy, takes place in Lisbon.
And finally the author would remind his reader that the
spirit of his piece is entirely Brazilian, trying to symbolize&mdash;and
more direct pretension would be anachronistic&mdash;the
differentiation which had already begun between
the mother country and its American colony,
which was destined to continue and propagate its historic
mission in the new world, and the economic importance
of which was daily becoming more manifest.”</p>

<p>It is in history that, with a few exceptions, Lima’s
most enduring work has been performed. He has recreated
the figure of Dom João VI (<i>Dom João no
Brasil</i>, 2 vols.); he has thrown light into dark places
of the national narrative, particularly in the period
beginning with the French invasion of Portugal that
sent John VI to Brazil in 1808 and thus made the colony
a virtual kingdom, and ending with 1821. “Dr. Lima’s
investigations in hitherto unused sources also led to a
revision of judgment,” wrote Professor P. A. Martin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
“of many personages and events of the period; an instance
of which is his successful rehabilitation of the
character of Dom John VI. This sovereign, treated
with contempt and contumely by the bulk of the Portuguese
historians who have never forgiven him for deserting
his native land, now appears in a new and deservedly
more favorable light. The author makes it
clear that John’s rule in Brazil was as liberal and progressive
as was desirable in a country in which all
thorough-going reforms must of necessity be introduced
gradually. And these same reforms, especially the
opening of the chief Brazilian ports to the commerce
of all friendly nations, not only redounded to the immediate
benefit of the country, but what was infinitely
more important, paved the way for ultimate independence.”<a name="FNanchor_1_133" id="FNanchor_1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_133" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
So well, indeed, that the year following
John’s departure is the year of Brazil’s complete emancipation.</p>

<p>Oliveira Lima’s internationalism&mdash;employing that
word in a broader sense than it is usually given in political
discussion&mdash;is thus at once territorial and spiritual.
He knows his own country too well to glorify it in the
unthinking patriotism of a Rocha Pitta; he knows the
rest of the world too well to harbour faith in the exclusivistic
loyalties that patriotism everywhere connotes.
His very books, as if to symbolize his universal attitude,
trace the amplification of his interests and of his cosmopolitan
spirit. He began with a study of his birthplace;
he continued with a study of his nation’s colonial letters;
he then initiated a series dealing with national, historical
figures and events, in conjunction with books upon the
four corners of the world. Latterly, as if to round out
the whole, he has completed a <i>History of Civilization</i>, intended
chiefly for use in Brazil’s higher centres of education;
but it is far more than a mere text-book. It is
the natural outgrowth of a dignified lifetime,&mdash;the work
of a man who, early placed in the diplomatic service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
outgrew the confines of that profession because, in simple
words, he was too human for it.</p>

<p>“In fact,” he himself once declared in a speech,
“to be a good diplomat is to be able to deceive
wisely.” And Lima has been wiser in goodness than in
deceit.</p>

<p>It is easy enough now, with the distance of a few
years between us and the end of a war that need never
have been fought, to proclaim a humanistic spiritual
world-unity. It was not easy for Lima while the war
was going on; perhaps he, as well as any other, recognized
the futility of his efforts to keep at least the western
hemisphere of the world sane during the carnage;
perhaps this was but an example of what one of his
youthful disciples has called his “quixotism.” It was,
together with these things, a simple, if striking, example,
of the man’s devotion to the truth he sees.</p>

<p>“Through love of the truth,” he said, at a banquet
given to him in Rio Janeiro in 1917, “I became a diplomat,
who did not correspond to the ideal of the type,
despite the remark of a departed friend of mine who
used to say that I had spent my life lying, in Europe,
Asia and America, saying, in foreign countries and to
foreign audiences, that Brazil possesses a dramatic history,
a brilliant literature, a promising economy,&mdash;in
short&mdash;all the characteristics of a civilization …, of
which my friend, apparently, was sceptical.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>“Through love of the truth, I am now a journalist
who ought to correspond to the ideal of the type, and if
I do not, it is for the simple reason that in a certain
sense, truth is the most burdensome luggage a person can
carry through life, for it is always getting into our way.
I don’t see why it should be inculcated with such arduous
effort&mdash;and, paradoxically, a sincere effort&mdash;into the
souls of children, since, in their future life it can cause
so much trouble to those of us who continue to invoke
and apply what was taught us as a virtue.”</p>

<p>If Lima has been an undiplomatic diplomat, he is an
unjournalistic journalist. As another paradox in his life,
this man of Brazilian birth, Portuguese education and
tri-continental wanderings has settled down in Washington,
D. C., having presented his remarkable library to
the Catholic University. Back from his present home
he sends, to be sure, political chronicle and such chat,
but also literary letters that are read with avidity by a
youth whom he is strongly influencing. This is the
stuff out of which a number of his books have grown;
it is the sort of journalism that Bernard Shaw has
boasted about, because of its intimate relation to significant,
immediate life.</p>

<p>That he has chosen the United States for his permanent
home sufficiently indicates a predilection early
evidenced in his book upon this country; but that preference
is neither blind nor unreasoned, any more than his
Pan-Americanism is the hollow proclamation that deceives
nobody less than alert South Americans. In his
attitude to our nation he is candid, direct, with the reserve
of a Martí, a Rodó, a Verissimo, only that he knows us
more intimately than did those sterling spirits. At the
end of a series of lectures dedicated to the then President
of Leland Stanford Junior University, John Casper
Branner, “distinguished scientist, eminent scholar and
true friend of Brazil,” and delivered at that university,
as well as others of this country, Lima declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
“The filiation and evolution of Portuguese America are
separate from those of Spanish America; not infrequently,
nay frequently rather, was this evolution hostile
to that of Spanish America; but today they have common,
identical interests, and a desire for a closer approximation
appears so reciprocal that this movement becomes
every day more pronounced and more firmly rooted.
For Pan-Americanism to be complete, it would be necessary
for the United States to ally itself with Latin
America, with the importance, the influence, the prestige,
the superiority to which its civilization entitles it&mdash;it
would not be human to do otherwise&mdash;but without any
thought, expressed or reserved, of direct predominance,
which offends the weaker element and renders it suspicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is this which those who, like myself, know and esteem
the United States,&mdash;and the best way of showing
one’s esteem is not by praising unreservedly,&mdash;are hoping
will come as the result of the great university movement
which is gradually crystallizing in this country. Here
idealism is a feature of the race (nor would you without
it belong to a superior race), an ideal so noble and elevated
as that of respect for the right of others, as that
of human solidarity through the unification of culture.
The great statesman who now presides over the destinies
of the Argentine Republic, proclaimed at the First Pan-American
Conference, at Washington, that America belonged
to all humanity, not to a fraction of it; and indeed
America is and will continue to be more and more
the field for the employment of European capital, of
study for European scholars, of commerce for European
merchants, of activity for European immigration. Only
thus will the New World fulfil its historical and social
mission and redeem the debt contracted with Europe,
which has given it its civilization.”<a name="FNanchor_2_134" id="FNanchor_2_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_134" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This is an example of that “Spirit of peace and concord
to which I have ever subordinated my spiritual
activity.”<a name="FNanchor_3_135" id="FNanchor_3_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_135" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>As an investigator, Lima has always gone to the
sources; he has the born historian’s patience with detail,
and if he lacks the music of a seductive prose, he compensates
for this more purely literary grace with a gift
for vivifying the men and events of the past. Thus, if
his sole venture into the historical drama has been unproductive
of dramatic beauty, his historical writings
abound in passages of colourful, dramatic power. Carlos
Pereyra, himself a prolific writer upon American
history, has, in his Spanish translation of Lima’s <i>Historic
Formation of the Brazilian Nationality</i>, compared
him to such painters of the soul as Frans Hals. “Oliveira
Lima paints portraits in the fashion of Hals. Thus
we behold his personages not only in the ensemble of the
canvas and in the external perfection of each figure, but
in that mysterious prolongation that carries us into the
intimate shadows of the personality.…”</p>

<p>Lima’s eclecticism is but the natural result of his
residence in many parts of the world; it is also an aspect
of a spiritual tolerance which is a trait of his personality,
and which despite his “historic Catholicism” evokes, even
from an unbeliever, the simple tribute which in this modest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
essay I seek to render as much to that personality as
to any of its products.</p>

<p>As for his growing influence upon the youth of Brazil,
I will let one of the most promising of those young men
speak for his colleagues. Writes Senhor Gilberto de
Mello Freyre,<a name="FNanchor_4_136" id="FNanchor_4_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_136" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “This independence of view and attitude
explains the fascination that he exercises over the intellectual
youth of Brazil.… He is generous toward
the newcomers, without for that reason being easy with
his praise. On the contrary, he is discreet. His generosity
never reaches the extremes of indulgence. His
intellectual hospitality has been great; he has been
a sort of bachelor uncle to the nation’s ‘enfants
terribles.’ He was one of the first to proclaim the
powerful, strange talents of Euclydes da Cunha. He
has sponsored other youthful intellects whose brilliant
future he can foresee, such as Sr. Assis Chateaubriand,
Sr. Antonio Carneiro Leão, Sr. Mario Mello, Sr. Annibal
Fernandes.”</p>

<p>There are men whose lives are the best books they
have written; to this company Manoel de Oliveira Lima
belongs. He has identified himself so completely with
the cultural history of his nation that, as I said at the
beginning, he is an integral part of it, and if his works
were removed from the national bookshelf, a yawning
gap would be left. That is the better nationalism, to
which he has devoted an unchauvinistic career of the
higher patriotism. He has, on the other hand, become
so essentially cosmopolitan as to have earned the rare
title of world-citizen. If more diplomats have not been
able to reconcile these two supposed “opposites,” it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
because such a patriotism is incompatible with the international
mind, but because under their ceremonial clothes
they hide the age-old predatory heart and serve the age-old
predatory interests. Lima has not labelled others,
and I am not going to label him; men, like countries, must
remain ever different. But countries, like men, may
bridge the gulf of difference by patient understanding,
and the rivers of blood that flow under those bridges must
be the blood of human tolerance and aid, not the blood
of barter and battle. It would be easy to point out a
certain “conservatism” in Lima, as in more than one
other, and yet, if it be possible for us to live in anything

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br />
<span class="smaller">GRAÇA ARANHA</span></h2>

<p>Graça Aranha, like Euclydes da Cunha
(from whom in so many other respects he is so
different), is a man virtually of a single book.
And, as <i>Os Sertões</i> in 1902 created so profound an impression
upon Brazilian letters as to suggest a partial reorientation
of the national literature, so, in the same
year, did the appearance of Aranha’s <i>Chanaan</i> work a
profound change in the Brazilian novel. Much ink has
been spilled about it and often, if not generally, in
that exalted rhetorical mood for which the Ibero-American
critic does not lack models abroad; upon the strength
of <i>Chanaan</i> alone, Senhor Costa (and not entirely without
justice) has created a new phase of the national
novel: the critico-philosophical; Guglielmo Ferrero, the
noted Italian historian, a corresponding member of the
Brazilian Academy of Letters, made it known to
Europe with his fulsome praise of it as the great American
novel,&mdash;a term that had already been applied to
<i>María</i> (by the Colombian Jorge Isaacs) and Taunay’s
<i>Innocencia</i>. There is a distinct basis for comparison between
<i>Innocencia</i> and the more famous tale from Colombia;
between these and <i>Chanaan</i>, however, there is little
similarity, if one overlooks the poetic atmosphere that
glamours all three. Aranha’s book is of far broader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
conception than the other two; it adds to their lyricism
an epic sweep inherent in the subject and very soon felt
in the treatment. It is, in fact, a novel difficult to classify,
impregnated as it is with a noble, Tolstoian idealism,
yet just as undoubtedly streaked with an unrelenting
realism so often coupled with the name of Zola. Yet
one does not perceive too plainly an inept mingling
of genres; the style is a mirror of the vast theme&mdash;that
moment at which the native and the immigrant strains
begin to merge in the land of the future&mdash;the promised
land that the protagonists are destined never to enter,
even as Moses himself, upon Mount Nebo in the land of
Moab, beheld Canaan and died in the thrall of the great
vision.</p>

<p>Aranha seems truly to have been called to this task
rather than to have chosen it. He is cosmopolitan by
culture as well as training. Himself a descendant of an
old family, he has not been hampered by the false aristocracy
of the family, else how could he have composed
the epic of Brazil’s melting-pot? He has served his
nation at home and abroad, having been secretary to
Joaquim Nabuco when that diplomat went to Italy to
settle before the king the boundary dispute between
Brazil and Great Britain in the matter of British Guiana;
he was Brazilian minister at Christiania, and later Plenipotentiary
for Brazil at The Hague. He is philosophically,
critically inclined; he knows not only the Latin
element of his nation, but the Teutonic as well; his native
exuberance has been tempered by a serenity that is the
product of European influence, in which may be reckoned
a tithe of English.</p>

<p><i>Chanaan</i> is of those novels that centre about an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
enthralling idea. The type that devotes much attention
to depictions of life and customs, to discussions of
present realities and ultimate purposes, is perhaps more
frequent among Spanish and Portuguese Americans than
among our own readers, who are too apt to be over-insistent
in their demands for swift, visible external action.
Yet, in the hands of a master, it possesses no less
interest&mdash;for myself, I freely say more&mdash;than the more
obvious type of fiction. Ideas possess more life than the
persons who are moved by them.</p>

<p>The idea that carries Milkau from the Old World to
the New is an ideal of human brotherhood, high purpose
and dissatisfaction with the old, degenerate hemisphere.
In the State of Espirito Santo, where the German
colonists are dominant, he plans a simple life that
shall drink inspiration in the youth of a new, virgin
continent. He falls in with another German, Lentz,
whose outlook upon life is at first the very opposite to
Milkau’s blend of Christianity and a certain liberal Socialism.
The strange milieu breeds in both an intellectual
languor that vents itself in long discussions, in brooding
contemplation, mirages of the spirit. Milkau is gradually
struck with something wrong in the settlement. Little
by little it begins to dawn upon him that attributes akin
to the Old-World hypocrisy, fraud and insincerity are
contaminating this supposedly virgin territory. Here he
discovers no paradise à la Rousseau&mdash;no natural man
untainted by the ills of civilization. Graft is as rampant
as in any district of the world across the sea; cruelty is
as rife. His pity is aroused by the plight of Mary, a
destitute servant who is betrayed by the son of her employers.
Not only does the scamp desert her when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
most needs his protection and acknowledgment, but he
is silent when his equally vicious parents drive her forth
to a life of intense hardship. She is spurned at every
door and reduced to beggary. Her child is born under
the most distressing of circumstances and devoured by
a pig before her very eyes, as she gazes helplessly on.</p>

<p>Mary is accused of infanticide, and since she lacks
witnesses, is placed in an extremely difficult position.
Moreover, the father of her child bends every effort
to loosen the harshest measures of the community
against her, whereupon Milkau, whose heart is open to
the griefs of the universe, has another opportunity to
behold man’s inhumanity to woman. His pity turns to
what pity is akin to; he effects her release from jail, and
together they go forth upon a journey that ends in the
delirium of death. The promised land has proved a
mirage&mdash;at least for the present. And it is upon this
indecisive note that the book comes to a close.</p>

<p>Ferrero,<a name="FNanchor_1_137" id="FNanchor_1_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_137" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in his introduction to the book is substantial
and to the point. It is natural that he should
have taken such a liking to the novel, for Aranha’s work
is of intense interest to the reader who looks for psychological
insight, and Ferrero himself is the exponent of history
as psychology rather than as economic materialism.
“The critics,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> “will judge the literary merits of
this novel. As a literary amateur, I will point out among
its qualities the beauty of its style and its descriptions,
the purity of the psychological analysis, the depth of
the thoughts and the reflections of which the novel is full,
and among its parts a certain disproportion between the
different parts of the book and an ending which is too
vague, indefinite, and unexpected. But its literary qualities
seem to me to be of secondary importance to the profound
and incontrovertible idea that forms the kernel
of the book. Here in Europe we say that modern civilization
develops itself in America more freely than in
Europe, for in the former country it has not to surmount
the obstacle of an older society, firmly established
as in the case of the latter. Because of this we call
America ‘the country of the young,’ and we consider the
New World as the great force which decomposes the
old European social organization.” That idea is, as
Ferrero points out, and as Milkau discovered for himself,
an illusion due to distance. Ferrero points out, too,
that here is everywhere “an old America struggling
against a new one and, what is very curious, the new
America, which upsets traditions, is formed above all
by the European immigrants who seek a place for themselves
in the country of their adoption, whereas the real
Americans represent the conservative tendencies.
Europe exerts on American society&mdash;through its emigrants&mdash;the
same dissolving action which America exerts&mdash;through
its novelties and its example&mdash;on the old
civilization of Europe.” The point is very well taken,
and contains the germ of more than one great novel of
the United States. And just as <i>Chanaan</i> stands by itself
in Brazilian literature, so might such a novel achieve pre-eminence
in our own.</p>

<p>“It is probable,” says Milkau to Lentz during one of
their numerous discussions, in words that may have
suggested this criticism to Ferrero and that may be
applicable to our own nation,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>“it is probable that our
fate will be to transform this country from top to bottom,
to substitute another civilization for all the culture,
religion and traditions of a people. It is a new conquest,
slow, dour, peaceful in its means, but terrible in its
ambitious schemes. The substitution must be so pure
and luminous that upon it may not fall the bitter curse
of devastation. In the meantime we are a dissolvent of
the race of this country. We soak into the nation’s clay
and soften it; we mix ourselves with the natives and kill
their traditions, and spread confusion among them.…
No one will understand anyone else; there is a confusion
of tongues; men coming from everywhere&mdash;bring with
them the images of their several gods; they are all alien to
each other; there is no communion of thought; men and
women do not make love to each other in the same words.…
Everything is disintegrating; one civilization falls
and is transformed into an unknown one.… The remodelling
of the nation is being set back. There is
tragedy in the soul of a Brazilian when he feels that
his race will not last for evermore. The law of nature
is that like begets like.… And here tradition is broken;
the father will not transmit his own image to his son;
the language is dying; the old aspirations of the race,
the deep-rooted desires for a distinct individuality, will
become dumb; the future will not understand the past.”<a name="FNanchor_2_138" id="FNanchor_2_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_138" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Ferrero is quite right in indicating the great non-literary
importance of the novel; indeed, Brazilian criticism,
as a whole, has in the consideration of <i>Chanaan</i> been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
dazzled by the language and the social implications of
the novel that it has overlooked or condoned its structural
defects as a work of art. But not all readers will
agree with Ferrero, I imagine, as to the excessive vagueness
of the end. Hardly any other type of ending would
have befitted a novel that treats of transition, of a
landscape that enthralls, of possibilities that founder, not
through the malignance of fate so much as through the
stupidity, the cupidity, the crassness of man. There is
an epic swirl to the finale that reminds one of the disappearance
of an ancient deity in a pillar of dust. For
an uncommon man like Milkau an uncommon end was
called for.</p>

<p>In this novelized document upon Brazil’s racial problems
and popular customs a certain and facile symbolism
seems to inhere. Milkau is, as we have seen, the blend
of Christianity and Socialism,&mdash;two concepts which, for
all their recent historic enmity, are closely related, though
by no means identical, in philosophical background.
Lentz is the apostle of Nietzscheanism. Mary is the suffering
land, a prey to the worse elements. The pot that
melts the peoples melts their philosophies. So are they
fused in this book, which terminates in a cloud, as of the
first smoke to rise from the crucible.</p>

<p><i>Chanaan</i> is not, for all its novelty and substantiality,
the “splendid alliance of artistic perfection and moral
grandeur” that one of its countless panegyrists has discovered
it to be. Neither does it contain that mixture of
Ibsen, Tolstoi, Zola, Sudermann, Maeterlinck and Anatole
France which was found in it by an editorial writer in
the <i>Jornal do Commercio</i>. Even Verissimo, it seems to
me, exaggerated the artistic importance of the novel in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
enthusiasm&mdash;a rare thing in Verissimo&mdash;over the newness
and the social significance of the book. He speaks of
its drama as being “curto, rapido e intenso,” yet surely
there is nothing “brief” or “rapid” in the telling of
<i>Chanaan</i>, though intense it undoubtedly is. “New in
theme,” he wrote, “new in inspiration and conception,
new in style, <i>Chanaan</i> is the first and only manifestation
worthy of appreciation among the new spiritual and
social currents that are everywhere influencing literature
and art. This novel brought to literature, not only
Brazilian but Portuguese as well, human and social preoccupations,
and modern forms of expression.…
It may well be that chronologically some other came before
him, but in art excellency is more important than priority.…
This is the first novel of its kind in Brazil or
Portugal. One may note the lack of action, that is, a
more or less complicated plot.… <i>Chanaan</i>, then, belongs
in the category of contemporary literature. The
intense drama that animates it is chiefly internal, but the
feelings, the sensations, the ideas vibrate in it like deeds.”
Like deeds, in truth, for feelings, sensations and ideas are
the raw material of action; more, the motive power itself
of “action.” Verissimo is not so much blind to the artistic
deficiencies of <i>Chanaan</i> as he is unmindful of them.
He readily grants that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> “not all the episodes adjust themselves
perfectly to the central action of the novel or even
to the general fact that it presents.… In a detailed
analysis of the architecture of the book perhaps other
objections would be possible, but contemplating the structure
as a whole&mdash;and this is how a work of art should be
viewed&mdash;the impression is one of solid beauty. <i>Chanaan</i>
is truly a work of talent in the most noble acceptation and
the rarest application of that word. With its generous
inspiration, its penetrating symbolism and its moving
lyricism … with its wealth of ideas and sensations
and its rare emotional sincerity, what is perhaps most
admirable in Graça Aranha’s novel is the difficult union&mdash;intimate
and perfect in this book&mdash;of the loftiest idealism
and the most inviting realism.”</p>

<p>Costa, as we have seen, has centred a new epoch of
the Brazilian novel around this one work, which he considers
to have fixed the moment of transition that is so
eloquently suggested in the passage from Milkau given
above. “The problem of immigration was disquieting,”
he writes. “Moreover, as reaction against French
culture,” (a reaction that is now again to the fore) “the
only culture that dominated without rivalry in Brazil,
our men of letters began to read the German authors:
Goethe, Kant, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche. It was a moment
of mental elaboration,&mdash;an élan, a great hope, a
fertile stirring of ideas, and, at the same time, there was
doubt as to one’s powers of resistance, incertitude,
puerile indecision, vague, formless aspirations,&mdash;that
state of semi-lethargy, with acute intermittent crises of
vitality, which characterizes the periods of transition
amongst individuals and nations, the burgeoning of the
youthful intelligence of a new people, the first attempts
at independence, the will to learn and to produce, to
affirm and to acquire the consciousness of one’s worth
as a nation amongst the nations. It was in this period
that there took place the most memorable event in the
intellectual life of Brazil: the foundation of the Brazilian
Academy of Letters.… Graça Aranha is, perhaps,
the fusion of two different cultures.” This is evident in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<i>Chanaan</i>, I may add in passing, without any reference to
the known facts of the man’s life and his education.
And though it may be <i>studied</i> in his book, from him it
flowed into the narrative out of his very nature. He
is, again in Costa’s words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> “the focal point of two vigorous
and independent Brazilian thinkers: Tobias Barreto
and Joaquim Nabuco. The mysterious power of the race,
its abandon, its sensual basis, its curiosity for learning&mdash;revealing
a little the rudimentary traits of the mixed
breed&mdash;the power of conception, the absolutist tendency,
that make and are the strength of Tobias Barreto, encounter,
in the manner of the law of compensation, a
moderating force, a stabilization of values in the Apollonian
genius of Joaquim Nabuco, in the Aryan clarity of
his ideas, the Hellenic grace of his concepts, the brilliancy
of his rhythmic style, so elegant, delicate and noble,&mdash;in
the loftiness of his thoughts, in his civilized relativism.
There are not in Brazil two spirits, two esthetics,
that are more different from, more antagonistic to,
each other. The first, despite his vast learning, his admiration
for and bedazzlement before European thought,
is in every attitude, every phrase, every gesture, an
American, Brazilian, an exuberant son of the tropics,
sensual and barbarous; the second, despite his love of
his native land, despite his devotion … is, in his
thought, in manner, in tastes, in soul, in ideas and affections,
in pleasures and in style, a European, a Latin, a
descendant in direct line of Greek culture. Graça
Aranha, by a phenomenon that I discover in his style,
has succeeded,&mdash;at the same time retaining complete independence,&mdash;in
effecting an alliance between two opposite
poles, the harmonious conjunction of these two
different principles, the integration into a single beautiful
and lofty form of these two contradictory esthetics.
He has transformed the sensualism of Tobias Barreto
into voluptuousness and the eloquence of Joaquim Nabuco
into poetry.”</p>

<p>Costa has stated the case with tropical luxuriance of
phrase and feeling; perhaps one must be a Brazilian
to see all this&mdash;<i>as art</i>&mdash;in the novel to which it is applied.
Take up the book in and for itself, as a product of a
sensitive imagination transmuting the elements of experience
into a new reality, and it contains, surely, all
the qualities that its most intense admirers discover, but
in less degree. Milkau is really the only character in
the novel; he is the soloist. Too many of the beautiful
thoughts remain here as isolated by-products of conversation
rather than living emanations of interplay of
emotions. There is a certain hesitancy as to form, which
is now the frank dialogue of the stage, now the exaltation
of a nativist hymn in a manner recalling, though of
course not repeating, Rocha Pitta. Milkau himself,
speaking doubtless for Aranha, says that “man is not governed
by ideas; he is governed by feelings,” yet, so like
the wise men who discover that simple truth, continues to
expatiate upon the ideas. Could his sentence, indeed,
have originated in one of simple feelings? The very recognition
that feeling dominates us is a token that it has
ceased to dominate entirely. This is another excellent
reason for that indecisive close of the book to which
Ferrero objected, for Milkau is caught in a mesh of indecision.
It reveals, in the author, one of the sources
of his own indecision as to form; but in the novel something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of that uncertainty is felt in the telling, and interferes
with one’s complete enjoyment in the epoch-making
book. Yet, strangely enough, out of the weakness
of the separate parts is forged a strength of the whole.
Once again, the book becomes the mirror of the folk
who people it, for out of the weakness of the individual
would Milkau make the strength of human solidarity.
“My eyes cannot reach the limits of the Infinite,” he
cries at the very end. “My sight is limited to what surrounds
you.… But I tell you, if this is going to end
so that the cycle of existence may be repeated again elsewhere,
or if some day we will be extinguished with the
last wave of heat coming from the maternal bosom of
earth, or if we be smashed with it in the Universe and be
scattered like dust on the roads of the heavens, let us not
separate from each other in this attitude of hatred.…
I entreat you and your innumerable descendants, let us
reconcile ourselves with each other before the coming
of Death.…”</p>

<p>To sum up the artistic aspect of the case, I would say&mdash;with
all admiration for the novel <i>Chanaan</i> and its
countless fascinating moments of speech, attitude and
vision&mdash;that the book itself is even in this respect a
mirror, a symbol, of its people and its problems: it is
a high promise rather than the perfect fulfilment that
so many of its critics would see in it. It ascends the
literary Mount Nebo, gazes toward the Promised Land,
but does not enter. It is one of the peaks of Brazilian
literature, both artistically (for detail) and historically
(as a whole), but I dare say that its artistic importance
will diminish as its historic significance increases. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>e’s
sharper critical examination of the book is a tribute to
its disturbing qualities and its peculiar individuality
among the products of the modern novel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Its historic importance is less to be questioned, though
it has not created a school. Costa’s very characterization
of it as a critico-philosophical novel contains a
criticism, which is further brought out in his short concluding
chapter upon his personal theory regarding the
Brazilian novel. For here he suggests as the coming
type what he calls the <i>esthetico-social</i> novel,&mdash;“the theory
of art for art’s sake employed in representing the social
moment of a people.” I am not concerned with this
inartistic theory; inartistic because it would choose the
subject for the artist, who alone has the right to select
and combine his materials. Neither am I concerned with
Costa’s uncomprehending attitude toward the Russian
novel, in which he can find only folly, cruelty and delirium!
It is a large world, and we must each write what
is in ourselves, not what preceptive critics would order to
fit in with their clamping theories. But I wish to point
out that Costa’s employment of the word <i>esthetic</i> in his
term for the novel of Brazil’s future indicates, for all his
praise of the Aranha book, a sense of something lacking
in <i>Chanaan</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<p>“The philosophy of Graça Aranha, … is a philosophy
of hope, of intoxication, before the glorious
majesty of nature; it is like a magnificent flower of dream,
life, desire, aspiration toward happiness, which returns
incessantly to the august bosom of the eternal Pan.
Man passes on; he is a particle of dust that is blown
for a moment across the earth. His whole struggle aims
to merge him with nature, through religion, through
love, through philosophy. It is this unceasing anxiety
to dissolve into something superior to ourselves that
produces the great mystics, the great lovers or the great
philosophers; yet, at bottom, life in itself is worth what
the dust is worth that glitters for an instant in the sun’s
rays.… Such surely is the philosophy of Graça
Aranha; a sunflower gilded by thought, it turns eternally
toward fleeting happiness, in a perpetual desire to merge
with it and drink in the light through its petals.…
Flower of serene, victorious life, but with distant roots
in the banks of the Ganges, nurtured by a vague pessimism,
in nihilism, in incipient anarchy, in the everlasting
beatitude of Nirvana.…”</p>

<p>This is the poetry of criticism, as <i>Chanaan</i> is the
poetry of the novel,&mdash;a poetry not unlike Alencar’s
<i>Guarany</i>, yet as unlike as Alencar was to Aranha.
Like Aranha’s novel, so this criticism, for all its preoccupation
with Brazilianism, is the result of European culture
acting upon the native spirit. It is but another revelation
of the literary axiom that renaissance springs
from the impact of foreign influences; parthenogenesis
is as rare in literature as in life.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">COELHO NETTO</span></h2>

<p>As Bilac is the poet of Brazilian voluptuousness,
Coelho Netto is its novelist. But there is this
essential difference: Bilac etches his lines while
Netto splashes the colours over his canvas with unthinking
prodigality. Bilac is the silver stream glittering along
through the landscape that it reflects with the transmuting
touch of its own borrowed silver; Netto is the gushing
torrent that sweeps everything along in its path, part
and parcel of the surrounding exuberance.</p>

<p>“Our literature lacks original character,” says the
talkative Gomes in <i>A Capital Federal</i>, one of Netto’s
earliest novels (1893),&mdash;less a novel, indeed, than a
series of impressions in which not the least element is
the fairly unceasing chatter of its persons. “It is not
really a national literature because, unhappily, nobody
concerns himself with the nation. The eyes of our
poets scan the constellations of other heavens, the waters
of other rivers, the verdure of other forests.” Again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
“We are still a people in process of formation,&mdash;still
at the beginning of life and yet, at the age when Greece
was lyrical, in the youthful days in which all men try
to compose poems of religion and hope for the shelter
of the soul, we despair, we are pessimistic.… By conviction?
Because of suffering? Absolutely not. Scarcely
by imitation. We lament in the cradle and ask for
death, Nirvana. We begin reading with the Book of
Job. Show me our Romantic period, which is, so to
speak, the adolescence of Art, in its second phase, after
the renaissance. We had none. We leaped into naturalism,
which is analysis, and already we are headed for
the cachexy of decadentism.…” There is much to
be said against the plaints of this citation, whether one
consider its nationalistic implications or its insinuation
that Brazil’s Romantic period lacked genuineness. I
quote it, however, to show that at the very beginning of
his career Netto intended a conscious reorientation of
the Brazilian novel away from the naturalism of Azevedo
in the direction of what we may term neo-romanticism.
Both men are concerned with what blurred
thinking so readily calls the baser passions; both are
sensualists, each envisaging life not so much through a
different theory as through a different temperament.</p>

<p>Netto is the Anselmo Ribas of his early books, wherein
already appears the voluptuary, the creature of extravagant
language and unbridled imagination, the weaver
of tangled imagery, the wielder of a copious vocabulary
that has been estimated at as high as 20,000 words.
And that voluptuary appears everywhere, in the images,
the narrative, the thoughts. “Amber-hued wine that
seems to sing in its glasses a dithyramb of gold,&mdash;impatient
wine that seethes and foams,&mdash;wine that rages
like the mighty ocean,&mdash;ambrosia of a new era,&mdash;live,
intelligent wine,&mdash;wine with a soul.” Such is the wine
that is drunk by Ribas and his friend Gomes, who has his
scents for each colour, sound and feeling. When the
silks of a lady rustle, the noise is comparable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sounds “made by the flocks of wild pigeons when they
raise their flight on the riverbanks of my native province.”
In his work, as in this simile, his sensuousness
is mingled with the primitivity of mother earth. He
has written much of the city life, and has traveled with his
pen through all the forms, but he is strongest when closest
to that primitive urge. I prefer him, for short tales,
in such an early work as <i>Sertão</i>; for the novel, in such a
concise miniature masterpiece as <i>Rei Negro</i>.</p>

<p>Henrique Maximiano Coelho Netto was born on February
21, 1864, in the city of Caxias, department of
Maranhão, of a Portuguese father and an Indian mother.
In 1870 the family moved to Rio de Janeiro. From his
slave attendant Eva he imbibed a wealth of Brazilian folk
lore; from Maria, the Portuguese housekeeper, he drank
in (and with what avidity his later work reveals) the
common heritage of Oriental tales. Another powerful
influence (and this, too, is duly chronicled in <i>A Capital
Federal</i>) was his uncle Rezende, a book-keeper with
a taste for the Portuguese and Latin classics. For the
fundamental traits of Netto as a creative spirit one need
hardly go farther than these childhood impressions.
Here we have his mixed blood, his predilection for the
native lore and exotic artistry, his preference for the ancient
writers and a fondness for the Portuguese classics
that reveals itself in his not infrequently archaic language.
Some of his pages, Verissimo has shown, would
be better understood in Portugal than in Brazil.</p>

<p>Though his early education lacked method, already at
the age of eight he read Cicero; he pursued his studies at
various institutions, never remaining through the complete
number of years. Like most Brazilians, he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
with a sonnet, followed by a number of poems which fortunately,
he never issued; his newspaper experience commenced
in the <i>Gazeta da Tarde</i>, 1887. Unlike most
Brazilians he wrested a living from the nation by his
pen, and 1892 found him teaching the history of the arts.
His restlessness, however, seems to keep him flitting from
place to place and from interest to interest. In 1900 he
is found in Campinas teaching literature, remaining for
three years. In 1909 he is back in Rio at the Gymnasio
Nacional, lecturing upon letters. From that year until
1917 he represents the state of Maranhão in the national
assembly. Today finds him busily at work revising the
long list of his labours and issuing them with as keen
an interest as if they were the first fruits of his imagination.</p>

<p>“Even to this day,” he confessed to an interviewer a
few years ago, “I feel the influence of the first period of
my life in the sertão. It was the histories, the legends,
the tales heard in my childhood,&mdash;Negro stories filled
with fear, legends of <i>caboclos</i> palpitant with sorcery,
tales of white men, the phantasy of the sun, the perfume
of the forest, the dream of civilized folk.… Never
did the mixture of ideas and race cease to predominate,
and even now it makes itself felt in my eclecticism.…
My imagination is the resultant of the soul of Negro,
<i>caboclo</i> and white.” The criticism is born out by a study
of his many books, most of which, as the author himself
would be the first to agree, will be speedily forgotten in
the excellence of the salient few.</p>

<p>Neo-romantic though he be, Netto is no believer in the
false Indianism that for a time held sway in the native
letters. His affection for the Portuguese tongue, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
he considers the most plastic of languages, does not preclude
a belief in a Brazilian literature. Asked whether
he was religious&mdash;and here again reading of his representative
books bears witness to his self-knowledge&mdash;he
replied, “Very. I don’t know whether I believe in Lord
Christ, or in Lord Nature, but I believe in the immanent
principle of divinity. And perhaps, for this reason,
I am one of the rare men who hope.”</p>

<p>“One may say of him,” writes Costa, “what Taine
said of Balzac: ‘he is a sort of literary elephant, capable
of bearing prodigious burdens, but slow of gait.’” And
before Costa, Netto said of himself that he was a “Trappist
of labor,&mdash;what the French call a <i>bête de somme</i>.”
Better than any one else Verissimo, upon whom Costa
largely draws for his consideration of Netto, has defined
the qualities of the prolific polygraph. Netto has
tried all the styles; he has from the first revealed that exuberance
which makes of him a splashing colourist, a
vivid describer of externals, an expert in word pageantry;
his prose is often a wild cataract, a tangled forest. He
is not a writer of ideas, but of sensations. Erroneously
he has termed himself a Hellenist and a primitive, unmindful,
as the scrupulous Verissimo has indicated, that these
terms in themselves are contradictory. Much of his
labour is “literature”; many of the novels are spoiled by
their evident origin in the desires of newspaper readers;
his fondness for archaisms offends linguistic common
sense; even his descriptions, according to the testimony of
compatriots, are largely invented, no truer to the native
scene than are some of his characters to the native life.
His defects, notably carelessness in structure, are the defects
of improvisation. And yet&mdash;for all that his critics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
so justly note, he compels the reader with the peculiar
fascination that is his own&mdash;the attraction of a volcano
in eruption, of a beauty whose very exoticism draws
even as it repels.</p>

<p>He is that rare flower of the literary life,&mdash;a personality.
His rôle has been that of a minor Balzac,
pouring forth volume after volume in disconcerting and
damaging confusion, coupled with that of a Mæcenas-Hugo,
encouraging the youth of his nation to ardent
effort in the arena of letters. “He reproduced,” says
Costa, “unconsciously in his own country what was being
practised in France consciously by the neo-romantics,
the idealists,&mdash;all those who revolted against the ever-increasing
asperities of agonizing naturalism.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much of what is best in Netto is concentrated in one of
his earliest books, <i>Sertão</i>, published in 1896 at Rio de
Janeiro. This is a collection of some seven tales notable
for atmosphere, power, poetry. In <i>Praga</i> (Curse), we
are plunged deep into the past of superstition and sensuality
that lies in the sertanejo’s breast. Even burning
with fever, Raymundo wants Lucinda. In his delirium
he recalls how he tried to rob, and murdered, Mãi Dina
the year before, the crime being laid to gipsies; the
murdered woman visits him in his visions and he has a
terrific battle with her; rushing forth from his cabin he
encounters a colt and mounting it, makes a mad dash, like
a Mazeppa of the sertão, for the salvation that he feels
lies in flight. He exhausts his mount and then makes
his wandering way to Mãi Dina’s grave; in a frenzy he
begins to slash right and left with his knife, when a misdirected
blow sends him rolling off into a swamp, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
he meets his end. Not her curse but his conscience has
wrought retribution. This is a strange mingling of
reality with fancy,&mdash;a sultry realism sprinkled with
scientific terms and heavy with tropical luxuriance of
phraseology; but there is poetry, too,&mdash;poetry of the indigenous
mind, as in the tale that follows: <i>O Enterro</i>
(The Burial). This account of the burial of the Indian
witch Tecai, a pagan for whom the pious Christians of
Itamina refuse even to give a coffin, is really a poem.
So too, largely, is <i>A Tapera</i>, a tale of mingled legend,
wild dream and virgin forest, in which the hermit of Santa
Luzia recounts to the teller, the tale of his beautiful wife
Leonor. Within a year she proved unfaithful and was
discovered by her husband’s black foster-mother Eva.
On the night of the discovery she is slain by Eva and together
they bury her. The husband goes mad, taking it
into his head that a certain tree follows him vengefully
about. Under that tree one day he digs her up
and morbidly caresses the skull. After hearing the tale,
the narrator dashes off on his horse at a mad gallop and is
told, three days later, that he must have dreamed all this
in a fever. This is strained situation, no doubt, but
Netto knows how to produce the Poesque thrill of horror,
not merely by accumulation of detail but by adroit manipulation
of it. That he may at times achieve simplicity is
shown in <i>Firmin, O Vaqueiro</i>, in which the aged cattleman
dies amidst the songs and the animals that he loved
and dominated so well, even as he did the girls of his
early hey-day. The song of the story might serve as
the epigraph to much of what Netto has written:</p>

<div class="verse">They call it passion, dark-brown maiden.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For sex in Coelho Netto is at once the Fate that snares
man and woman and the Furies who pursue them. Take
<i>Céga</i> (Blind), one of the best things he has done; it is a
powerful tale, instinct with a deep human pity, yet with
no trace of preceptiveness. Life here goes and comes
with the radiant indifference of the sun that shines over
all and of the crickets that shrill their monotonous accompaniment.
Anna Rosa, married to Cabiúna, loses
her sight at the birth of her child Felicia; then, through
the fever of the sertão, she loses her Cabiúna; then she
loses Felicia herself, because the maiden has kept her approaching
motherhood a secret until it is too late. The
grandchild lives on as a token of the continuity of life’s
urge, which brooks no restraint of human laws. Rarely
does Netto attain such proportion in description, narrative,
psychology; here Nature may smile upon her folk,
but humour, gladness do not dwell for long amongst them.
Even when humour comes, it is the smiling face of fear,
as in the account of <i>Mandoví</i>, the <i>caboclo</i> whose superstitious
fancy was lashed into terror by a forest bird that
seemed to be calling his name and by a wraith-like palm-leaf
swaying in the moon. Most gruesome of all, yet
of undeniable fascination, is the concluding tale, <i>Os
Velhos</i>, (The Aged Couple),&mdash;a study in obsession that
is passed on by an old husband to his faithful wife. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
suffers from a sort of catalepsy and fears that some day,
while in the death-like state, he will be buried alive. At
last his final attack slays him, but she, fearing lest he be
not really gone, lets him rot in his hut until the stench
rises beyond endurance and the village populace take
matters into their own hands. It is harrowing, repelling,
morbid, but done with something of the skill that
a Poe attains in such a piece as <i>The Fall of the House of
Usher</i>. The motif of the ominous urubus&mdash;the black
vultures of the southern continent&mdash;is most artistically
handled, as is that of the contagious obsession as it
grows upon the aged husband. Even here we discover
evidence of the author’s voluptuousness, inverted to be
sure, until it becomes a species of olfactory sadism.
Few tales display such an effective treatment of the sense
of smell made into an inevitable, primary attribute of
the story itself.</p>

<p><i>Rei Negro</i> (The Black King) belongs to the maturity
of the writer’s career, having appeared in 1914. It is
told in straightforward, uninterrupted manner, without
an entangling opulence of words or a dazzling series of
irrelevant descriptions. Equally at home in the desert
sertão, the glitter of life in the capital, or the <i>fazenda</i>
that is a link between the two, the author in this novel,
presents as background the lively, multifarious life upon
a large plantation, and as persons, the proprietors above
and the virtual serfs below. The bare plot is simplicity
itself; a favourite slave, Macambira, marries one of the
black belles of the <i>fazenda</i>; the son of the proprietor, indulged
since his birth and sensuous with the double unrestraint
of climate and assumed racial prerogatives, attacks
and overcomes the prospective bride. Fright seals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the woman’s lips, but when, after her happy marriage,
the child is born white, the truth must come out. The
proprietor’s efforts to hide his son’s misdeed&mdash;for the
child is born during a prolonged absence of the woman’s
husband&mdash;prove abortive and Macambira wreaks vengeance
by slaying his wife’s assailant. The wife has died
in the agony of her knowledge and the birth; the husband,
once his revenge is accomplished, disappears beyond the
mountains.</p>

<p>This is no common slave, however; Macambira, from
the lips of the old Balbina, hears thrilling accounts of his
regal provenience. Here he is but a humble black;
among his own tribe, yonder in the African wilds, he is
a king, a black king. His wrongs are more than matters
of individual care; his slaying of Julinho is more than a
personal vengeance. It is the vengeance of a tribe, the
assertion of a race, the proclamation of human dignity.
The greater to heighten the contrast between black and
white, Netto has made Macambira a chaste, Herculean
figure, proof against the temptations of mind and milieu
to which Julinho succumbs and is ultimately sacrificed.
The environment is drawn with swift, but effective
strokes; the minor characters really live; there is genuine
pathos in the common situation out of which the author
draws uncommon results; there is poetic beauty, as well
as psychological power, to the legendary evocations of
old Balbina as she whispers the tale of greatness into the
black king’s ears and arouses his spirit to what to him is
a mighty deed.</p>

<p>I have singled out, for more than passing comment,
but two works of some threescore and a half that range
from short tales and newspaper fragments to the novel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the drama, the text-book, speeches and essays upon the
education of women. For such early novels as <i>A Capital
Federal</i> and such later ones as <i>A Conquista</i> I can feel no
literary interest; they are, together with more than one
other of their fellows, valuable for a study of the day in
which they were written and for the instable temperament
that produced them. Similarly, <i>Esphinge</i>, a novel
of exotic mystery that begins with high promise soon
descends to the helpless confusion which threatens all
dallying with other-worldly themes, particularly when the
author would maintain contact with external reality rather
than plunge frankly and fearlessly into the unseen realms.
As to the short stories, one may open any collection quite
at random; the good will be strangely mixed with the bad.
Now the tale is a mere excuse for commentary, usually
upon men and women and passion, with Netto in cynical
mood; nature becomes a luxuriant, inciting procuress, as
witness the long titular story in the collection called
<i>Agua de Juventa</i> (Fountain of Youth),&mdash;a tale that, like
more than one of Netto’s, belongs rather to the liquor
and cigars of stag parties than to literature. Not,
understand, because it is “immoral,” but because it lacks
the texture, the illumination, the significance, of art.
That he can be sentimental he shows in <i>Epithalamio</i> of
the same collection; the propaganda impulse is so strong
that it overflows into tale after tale. And over it all, the
fructifying ardour of his voluptuousness, as prodigal as
nature itself, which scatters myriad seeds where only one
can take root and thrive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Naturalism,” writes Costa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> “with Aluizio de
Azevedo was the epic of the race’s sexual instincts; with
Coelho Netto, neo-romanticism will be the eternal praise
of Nature,&mdash;the incessant and exaggerated exaltation of
the landscape.” Both “isms,” I believe, are but the reflection
of the authors’ temperaments; in Netto, Nature
is but one of the symbols of sex, one of the means of representing,
expressing the superabundant vitality. It is
his imagination that works upon Nature rather than
Nature upon his imagination; he is a distorting mirror;
he has not created character, he has not invented situation,
so much as he has utilized men, places and events in the
presentation of his overflowing personality.</p>

<p>As a historical phenomenon, Coelho Netto represents
veritably a period in the national letters; literature becomes
a self-supporting profession&mdash;it had already been
that with Aluizio de Azevedo&mdash;and the production of
a steady stream of novels for avid metropolitan readers
is as systematized as ever in our own supposedly more
materialistic nation. As an artist Netto is less significant;
haste, disorientation and constant supply of a none
too exigent demand rendered him less exacting with himself,&mdash;something
that by nature he has never been in any
case, though he can view his labours objectively and
note their demerits. A spontaneous, not a premeditative
artist, achieving, at his most happy moments, a glowing
union of creature and creation,&mdash;a creation truly
Amazonian in its prodigality of scene and sense, with
creatures as unreal, yet as fascinating as itself. This is
no small accomplishment, for it makes of the reader a
participant, and that is what all art, major or minor, must
do. Netto here expresses not only the ardent Brazilian
dwelling amidst a phantasmagoria of the senses; this
overflow of primitive instincts is a human heritage that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with its torch of life, makes us no less than the one touch
of nature, kin to the rest of the world. “The Colonel’s
lady and Mary O’Grady are sisters under the skin,” sang
Kipling, to whom Netto has been rashly compared. And
changing the genders, the Colombian poet Silva has sung
in the poem Egalité of his <i>Gotas Amargas</i> (Bitter
Drops)</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br />
<span class="smaller">FRANCISCA JULIA</span></h2>

<p>Women have played an interesting, if necessarily
minor part in the material and cultural
development of the South American
republic. The name of the world’s largest river&mdash;the
Amazon, or, more exactly speaking, the Amazons&mdash;is
supposed to stand as a lasting tribute to the bravery of the
early women whom the explorer Orellana encountered
during his conquest of the mighty flood; according to this
derivation, by many considered fanciful, he named the
river in honour of the tribes’ fighting heroines, though a
more likely source would be the Indian word “amassona”
(i. e., boat-destroyer, referring to the tidal phenomenon
known as <i>bore</i> or <i>proroca</i>, which sometimes uproots trees
and sweeps away whole tracts of land). Centuries later,
when one by one the dependencies of South America rose
to liberate themselves from the Spanish yoke, the women
again played a noble part in the various revolutions.
The statue in Colombia to Policarpa Salvarieta is but a
symbol of South American gratitude to a host of women
who fought side by side with their husbands during the
crucial days of the early nineteenth century. One of
them, Manuela la Tucumana, was even made an officer in
the Argentine army.</p>

<p>If women have enshrined themselves in the patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
annals of the Southern republics, they have shown that
they are no less the companions of man in the
agreeable arts of peace. When one considers the great
percentage of illiteracy that still prevails in Southern
America, and the inferior intellectual and social position
that has for years been the lot of women particularly in
the Spanish and Portuguese nations, it is surprising that
woman’s prominence in the literary world should be what
it is. Yet the tradition&mdash;if tradition it may be called&mdash;boasts
a remarkable central figure in the person of Santa
Teresa, of sixteenth century Spain. “A miracle of
genius” was that famous lady, in Fitzmaurice-Kelly’s
fulsome words, … “perhaps the greatest woman
who ever handled pen, the single one of all her sex who
stands beside the world’s most perfect masters.” In the
next century, Mexico produced a personality hardly less
interesting in Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, (who only
yesterday was indicated as her nation’s first folklorist and
feminist), blazoned forth to her audience as “la Musa
Decima mexicana,”&mdash;nothing less than the tenth muse,
if you please, who happened then to be residing in
Mexico. And we of the North, in the same century, ourselves
boasted a tenth muse in the English-born Anne
Bradstreet of Massachusetts Colony, whose book of
verses was published in London, in 1650 (ten years after
the original Massachusetts edition) with the added line,
“The Tenth Muse, lately sprung up in America.”<a name="FNanchor_1_139" id="FNanchor_1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_139" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The most distinguished Spanish poetess of the nineteenth
century, Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Cuban by birth, going later to Spain, where she was
readily received as one of the nation’s leading literary
spirits. Her poetry is remarkable for its virile passion;
her novel “Sab” is the Spanish “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
She was a woman of striking beauty, yet so vigorous in
her work and the prosecution of it that one facetious
critic was led to exclaim, “This woman is a great deal of
a man!” This, too, is in the tradition, for had not Sor
Juana Ines de la Cruz, as a girl, been so eager for learning
that she begged her parents to send her to the University
of Mexico in male attire? She was hardly more
than eight at the time, to be sure, but the girl is mother
to the woman no less than the boy is father to the man.</p>

<p>South America has its native candidate for the title of
Spanish “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and this, too, is the work
of a woman. Clorinda Matto’s <i>Aves Sin Nido</i> (Birds
Without a Nest) is by one of Peru’s most talented
women, and exposes the conscienceless exploitation of the
Indians. In Peru, it would seem, fiction as a whole has
been left largely to the pens of women. Such names as
Joana Manuele Girriti de Belzu, Clorinda Matto and
Mercedes Cabello de Carbonero stand for higher aspiration
rather than achievement, but they reveal an unmistakable
tendency. The latest addition to their
number is the youthful Angélica Palma, daughter of the
famous author of the <i>Tradiciones Perruanas</i>.</p>

<p>Brazil has not yet produced any woman who has secured
the recognition accorded to Sor Juana Ines de la
Cruz or to Gómez de Avellaneda; it has, however, added
some significant names to the Ibero-American roster.
To poetry it has given Narcisa Amalia, Adelina Vieira,
Julia Lopes d’Almeida, Zalina Rolim, and lastly Francisca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Julia da Silva. They are sisters in a choir that
boasts choristers in every nation of the Ibero-American
group,&mdash;now a civic spirit like the Dominican Salomé
Ureña, who belongs to the latter half of the nineteenth
century, now such a more passionate continuator as the
lady who writes in Puerto Rico under the pseudonym of
La Hija del Caribe (The Daughter of the Carribees),&mdash;again
the Sapphic abandon of Alfonsina Storni of Argentina,
the domestic charm of Maria Enriqueta of Mexico,
the pallid perfection of the Uruguayan Juana
de Ibarbourou, the apostolic intensity of Gabriela
Mistral (Lucilla Godoy) of Chile, and the youthful
passion of Gilka Machado, youngest of the new Brazilians.</p>

<p>These women do not, as a rule, and despite some too
broad assumptions in South America as to the exclusively
materialistic spirit of the United States, enjoy the advantages
of culture that are possessed by our lady poets.
There is no Amy Lowell among them to revel in the
smashing of canons and amuse herself with the erection
of new ones for others to smash. There is no atmosphere
of Bohemianism and night life in metropolitan
cafés. Facile analogies might be drawn, but not too
much faith should be placed in them. Thus Maria Enriqueta
would suggest Sara Teasdale; Alfonsina Storni
would similarly suggest Edna St. Vincent Millay, who is
indubitably her superior. Over them all, except in the
rare and welcome moments of spiritual rebellion, hovers
an air of domesticity, as if, upon venturing into the half-forbidden
precincts of art,&mdash;which means perfect expression
and therefore is “unwomanly,”&mdash;they carried with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
them something of that narrower home and hearth which
only now they are abandoning.</p>

<p>“It is not easy,” wrote Verissimo upon the consideration
of a volume of poetry by Sra. D. Julia Cortines,
“to speak freely of women as authors, since, however
much as writers they detach themselves from their sex,
the most elementary gallantry requires us to treat them
solely as women. I, who am very far from being a feminist
(which is perhaps not quite consistent with my social
opinions), do not deny absolutely the intellectual capacities
of womankind, and, with the same impartiality (at
least, so I presume) I cannot discover in them any exceptional
qualities of heart or mind.… It may have
been for this reason that the Muse, who is a woman, never
deigned to endow me with her favors and denied me the
gifts of poesy.… Happily, Brazilian poetesses are
few in number; unhappily, they are not good poets. Almost
all, past and present, are mediocre. There has been
none up to this time who might dispute a place with the
half dozen of our best poets of the other sex. I could
never understand, or I understand it in a manner that
could hardly brook explanation, since woman according
to current opinion is far richer in matters of feeling
than man, she has never given anything really notable or
extraordinary in art, which is chiefly feeling.… One
of the forces of art is sincerity, and woman, either because
her own psychological organism forbids it, or because
the social organization that limits her expansion
has never consented to it, has never been able to be
sincere without endangering her privileges or even declassifying
herself.” Love, he continues, being the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of lyric themes, and woman prevented by social custom
from really expressing herself, the virtual silence of
woman in art is inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_2_140" id="FNanchor_2_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_140" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Some such reasoning as this explains the domesticity
of the women poets. It explains, too, I believe, why
Francisca Julia, for whom a number of Brazilian critics
would claim a respectable place with the men of her
nation, embraced the Parnassian cult during the few years
that were vouchsafed her. She was, if her poems tell
anything, an ardent spirit; her passions were too great
for the routine of civic and domestic verse; she would do
something more than merely transfer her “kitchen,
church and children” into homiletic poems. Lacking
either the courage or the temperament of an Alfonsina
Storni, she could express herself through an apparently
cold and formal imagery. Her early impassivity may
have been the defence reaction of a highly sensitive
compassionate nature. Throughout her work she is, if
we must use terms, more “Parnassian” than a number of
avowed men of that cult, which had reached its crest in
Brazil at the time Francisca Julia was emerging from
adolescence. She was little more than twenty when her
first collection, <i>Marmores</i>, appeared in 1895, and it is
common knowledge that she had been writing then for
some six years for such organs as the <i>Estado de São
Paulo</i> (one of the most important, and the oldest, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Brazilian newspapers), the <i>Correio Paulistano</i>, the <i>Diario
Popular</i>, the <i>Semana</i>. Between <i>Marmores</i> and the
next book, <i>Esphinges</i>, intervened some eight years. Late
in 1920 she died, and perhaps the crown of her recognition&mdash;for
her ability had been recognized with the publication
of her first book&mdash;was the phrase from the speech
by Umberto de Campos in the Brazilian Academy of
Letters, on November 4th, several days after her burial.
“If the Academy of Letters, upon its establishment, had

<p>As her poetry was cold imagery of her ardent inner
life, so are the titles of Francisca’s two books of verse
symbols of her artistic aims. <i>Marmores</i> and <i>Esphinges</i>:
the first, the marble of the statue, external aspect of impassivity;
the second, the silent sphinx, symbol of internal
passionlessness. She was a vestal tending the eternal
flame, but the fire was carved out of stone. Her artistic
life traces a curve from religious serenity and impassability
to compassion, thence to a sort of indifferentism.
All this was inherent in her early paganism, to which in
later life she really returns. Her mastery of form is,
one feels, a mastery of her emotions; much of her poetry
is impassive, chiefly <i>a fior di labbra</i>, as the Italians would
say,&mdash;on the rim of her lips. Not that she is insincere.
For, as there is a sincerity of candour, so is there a sincerity
of silence. The sphinx, a poetic figure, cannot,
from its very muteness, be a poet, though its speechlessness
lends itself to poetry. Francisca Julia, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
much she would be the sphinx, more than once gives the
answers to her own questionings. It is then that she is
most at one with her art, producing some of the finest
poetry that has come out of modern Brazil.</p>

<p>Her <i>ars poetica</i> is summed up in the two sonnets
grouped under the title <i>Musa Impassivel</i> (Impassive
Muse) and serving as the motto of the collection <i>Marmores</i>.</p>

<p>This is genuine aristocracy of comportment; it is genuine
attitude rather than absence of feeling. Note that
the poet’s Muse is not to reveal the sign of her emotions
lest they sully the beauty of her countenance; the emotions,
however, are there, and tears, at times, fall from
the stony eyes. Such emotion, in her finer work, is most
artistically blended with the aloofness that Francisca
Julia sought. Impassivity is a meaningless word for
poets, since it cannot by very nature seek to express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
itself, being the antithesis of expression; withdrawal,
however, is a legitimate artistic trait, and she exhibits
it in as successful a degree as has been attained by any
poet of her country. So much a part of her nature is
her coyness, that even when conquered by feminine pity
she conveys her mood through an imagery none the less
effective for its indirection; as in <i>Dona Alda</i>:</p>

<p>This is not poetry that shakes one to the depths, nor
does it come from one who was so shaken; but there is
artistry in ivory as well as in marble, and Francisca Julia
here has caught the secret of the light touch that stirs the
deep response.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable sonnet that opens the collection
<i>Esphinges</i>, and I wonder whether it is not, in symbolized
form, the keynote to the woman’s poetic aloofness.</p>

<p>Read for the first time the <i>Dança de Centauras</i> (Dance
of the Centaurs, and note that these centaurs are females);
a sonnet of sculptural, plastic beauty, you are
likely to tell yourself, as vivid as a bas-relief come suddenly
to life. Read it again, more slowly, and its impassivity
seems to melt into concrete emotion; this is virgin
modesty hiding behind verse as at other times behind
raiment. The poet herself is in the dance of the centaurs
and leads them in their flight when Hercules appears.
It is worth noting, too, that the poem does not
reach its climax until the very last words are spoken; the
wild rout is a mystery until the very end. Form and
content thus truly become the unity that they are in the
artist’s original conception.</p>

<p>It is the twilight and the night that bring to her lines
their more subjective moods; but even here, rarely do
present emotions invade her. It is as if she must feel by
indirection, even as she writes&mdash;now harking back to a
longing, now looking forward unmoved, to the inevitable
end. Yet there are moments when the impassive muse
forgets her part; she strides down from her pedestal and
cries out upon Nature as a “perfidious mother,” creator,
in the long succession of days and nights, of so much
vanity ever transforming itself. This Parnassianism
then, is the mask of pride. And in such a sonnet as
<i>Angelus</i> the mask is thrown off:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Oft, at this hour, when my yearning speaks</div>
<div class="verse">Through the lips of night and the droning chimes,</div>
<div class="verse">Chanting ever of love whose grief o’erwhelms me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse">I would be the sound, the night, full madly drunk</div>
<div class="verse">With darkness,&mdash;the quietude, yon melting cloud,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Or merge with the light, dissolving altogether.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This pantheism is paralleled, in <i>Vidas Anteriores</i>
(Previous Lives) by her consciousness of having lived,
in the past, a multiplicity of lives. It may be said, in
general, that as a modern pagan she is far more real
than as the rhyming Christian she reveals herself in her
few attempts at religious poetry.</p>

<p>Shortly before her death she wrote a sonnet called
<i>Esperança</i> (Hope), that is clear presentiment. She did
not weaken at its approach; she was, as near as is humanly
possible, the impassive muse of her own sonnets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I know it’s a kindly road and the journey’s brief.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her didactic works, <i>Livro da Infancia</i>, published in
1899, consisting of prose and verse, and <i>Alma Infantil</i>,
written in collaboration with Julio Cesar da Silva, 1912,
for school use, do not belong to her major productions.
It is significant of the status of the Brazilian text-book,
as well as of the varied tasks thrown upon the shoulders
of the educated in a continent where the major portion
of the population has been thus far condemned to illiteracy,
when we see how frequently even the major creative
spirits of the country turn to the writing of text-books.
Yesterday Olavo Bilac, fellow Parnassian of Francisca
Julia, spared time for the labour; today Coelho Netto,
Oliveira Lima, Monteiro Lobato do so. Again and
again is one reminded what a sacrifice, what a luxury, is
the creative life in a land that lacks anything like the
creative audience. And how much better off are we, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
are only on the threshold of a truly national literature?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not impossible that the fame of Francisca Julia
da Silva will grow with the coming years. She will be
recognized not only as a gifted woman who was one of
the few to carry on, worthily, the difficult perfection of
Heredia, Leconte de Lisle, Theophile Gautier and their
fellows, but as the equal, when at her best, of Brazil’s
foremost Parnassians. There are not many sonnets in
the poetry of Olavo Bilac, who so generously received
her, to match the sheer artistry of her <i>Dance of the
Centaurs</i>, her <i>Argonauts</i>, her <i>Impassive Muse</i>. Indeed,
compare the <i>Impassive Muse</i> with Bilac’s over-ardent
<i>Profissão de Fe</i> (Profession of Faith) and see whether
the woman has not in the very words and images and
tonality of the piece exhibited the inner and outer example
of that Parnassianism which Bilac here expresses
in words rather than attains in spirit. Bilac, as we have
seen, was too passionate a nature not to warm all his
statues to life; in Francisca, as João Ribeiro said in his
preface to <i>Marmores</i>, we find “ecstasy rather than passion,”&mdash;a
cold ecstasy, one might add, like the upper regions
of the atmosphere, which, though flooded with the
sunlight, are little warmed by its passage through them.</p>

<p>The same commentator suggests, as a possible reason
for her acute auditive sense, the short-sightedness from
which she suffered. Her poetry, indeed, is a hearing
poetry, but a seeing one as well. The few superior
pieces she has left are among the rare productions of
Brazilian verse; they are, in that province, unsurpassed
for their blend of the proportion that we usually call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
classic with that harmonious sensitivity which is supposedly
the trait of refined modernity. If in art it is the
individual rather than the literature that counts, and if
in that individual’s labour it is only what we consider best
that really matters, I should venture the seemingly rash
statement that Francisca Julia da Silva is the equal, as a
personality in verse, of Machado de Assis. He, too,
was a cold poet, even as a Romantic, yet never attained
the ecstasy of her salient pieces. He, too, was withdrawn,
aloof, and might have signed such a poem as
Francisca Julia’s <i>O Ribeirinho</i> (The Streamlet), without
any one being the wiser. Yet his aloofness&mdash;speaking
solely of his work in verse&mdash;was on the whole lack of
emotion, while hers is suppression, domination, transmutation
of it. She can be as banal as Wordsworth,
and has written in her <i>Inverno</i> (Winter) probably two of
the most prosaic lines of verse that Brazilian poetry
knows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Das quatro estaçoes de todas,</div>
<div class="verse">O inverno é a peor, de certo.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of all the four seasons</div>
<div class="verse">Winter’s certainly the worst.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She committed her childhood indiscretions, as do we
all, though in less abundance. At her best, however,
(and neither is this too abundant) she should rank with
the few Brazilian creators who have produced a charm
that is sister to Keats’s eternal joy. She has no landscapes
labelled native; her longing is no mere conventional
<i>saudade</i>; she formed no preconceived notion of
Brazilianism; she simply wrote, amidst her labours, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
two or more score lines that cannot be omitted from any
consideration of Brazilian poetry, because they enriched
it with a rare, sincere artistry that may find appreciation
wherever the language of men and women is beauty.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<br />
<span class="smaller">MONTEIRO LOBATO</span></h2>

<p>Among recent literary currents that present
several interesting phases one should not overlook
the nationalistic tendencies in Brazil,
championed so ardently and with such immediate effect
by the most active of the “new” spirits, Monteiro Lobato.
Lobato is but little over thirty-five and has at
hand for his purpose an influential publishing house in
São Paulo; he is thus able to make himself heard and
read as well as felt; he seems to be, in the intellectual
sense of the word, a born propagandist; certainly he
does not lack ink or courage and whatever one may
think of his ideas, he makes highly entertaining and
instructive reading. First and foremost he is the champion
of the national personality. And by that same
token he becomes the enemy of undue foreign influence
upon the nation. As one reads his numerous short
stories, his crisp and vigorous criticisms and his essays,
one comes to the realization that, as far as Lobato is
concerned, foreign influence is chiefly French and in
large measure to be condemned.</p>

<p>The profound effect of French literature upon Spanish
and Portuguese America is as undeniable as it is occasionally
deleterious, but it is possible to overstate the case
against the French influence in Brazil and, as one strikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in Lobato the same protest reiterated time and again, one
begins to feel that he is somewhat afflicted with Gallophobia.
Yet this is, after all, on his part, the over-emphasis
of earnestness rather than an absolute error in
values. He is not lacking in appreciation of the great
Frenchmen; he does not seem to scorn the use, as epigraph
to one of his children’s books, a quotation in
French from Anatole France; he does not object to having
some of his short stories mentioned in the same breath
with de Maupassant and, above all, he recognizes the
creative power of imitation, however paradoxical that
may sound. “Let us agree,” he writes, in the preface to
his stimulating collection of critiques, <i>Idéas de Jéca Tatú</i>,
“that imitation is, in fact, the greatest of creative forces.
He imitates who assimilates processes. Who copies,
does not imitate; he steals. Who plagiarizes does not
imitate, he apes.” The whole book he presents as “a
war-cry in favor of personality.” At the bottom of Lobato’s
nationalism is the one valid foundation of art: sincerity.
If he occasionally overdoes his protest, he may
well be forgiven for the sound basis of it; it is part of his
own personality to see things in the primary colors, to
play the national zealot not in any chauvinistic sense&mdash;he
is no blind follower of the administrative powers, no nationalist
in the ugly sense of cheap partisan drum-beating&mdash;but
in the sense that true nationalism is the logical
development of the fatherland’s potentialities. A personally
independent fellow, then, who would achieve for
his nation that same independence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The beginning of the World War found Monteiro
Lobato established upon a <i>fazenda</i>, far from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
thoughts and centres of literature. It was by accident
that he discovered his gifts as a writer. The story is
told that one day, rendered indignant by the custom of
setting fire to the fields for cleansing purposes, and thus
endangering the bordering inhabitants, he sent a letter
of protest to a large daily in São Paulo. It seems that
the letter was too important, too well-written, too plainly
indicative of natural literary talent, to be relegated to
the corner where readers’ jeremiads usually wail, and
that, instead, it was “featured” upon the first page.
From that day the die was cast. The episode, in my
opinion, is far more important than it appears. For,
whatever form in which the man’s later writings are published,
they are in a more important degree just what
this initial venture was: a protest, a means of civic betterment,
a national contribution. Turn this letter and
its mood into a short story and you have, say, such a
tale-message as <i>O Jardineiro Timotheo</i>, in which even
a garden may be transformed into a mute, many-hued
plea for the native flora; make politics of it, and you
get such a genuinely humorous product as <i>A Modern
Torture</i>, from that strange collection called <i>Urupês</i>.
Indeed is not the piece <i>Urupês</i> itself a critique and an
exposition of the indigenous “cobrizo”?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was with the collection <i>Urupês</i> that Monteiro
Lobato definitely established himself. In three years it
has reached a sale that for Brazil is truly phenomenal:
twenty thousand copies. It has been extravagantly
praised by such divergent figures as the uncrowned laureate
Olavo Bilac (who might have had more than a few
words to say about legitimate French influence upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Brazilian poetry) and the imposing Ruy Barbosa, who
instinctively recognized the fundamentally sociological
value of Lobato’s labours. For of pure literature there
is little in the young Saint-Paulist. I fear that, together
with a similar group in Buenos Aires, he underestimates
the esthetic element in art, confusing it, perhaps, with the
snobbish, aloof, vapoury spirits who have a habit of infesting
all movements with their neurotic lucubrations.
Yet such a view may do him injustice. His style, his
attitude, his product, are directly conditioned by the ambient
in which he works and the problems he has set out
to solve. Less unjust, surely, is the criticism that may
be made against him when his earnestness degenerates
into special pleading, when his intense feeling tapers off
into sentimentality and when what was meant to be humour
falls away to caricature. From which it may be
gathered that Lobato writes&mdash;or rather reprints&mdash;too
much; for plenty of good journalism should be left where
it first appeared and not be sent forth between covers.
Also, in an appreciable amount of his work, his execution
lags behind his intention, owing in no small measure to a
lack of self-discipline and an artistically unripe sincerity.</p>

<p><i>Urupês</i> was soon followed by <i>Idéas de Jéca Tatú</i>,
his Jéca Tatú being a fisherman of Parahyba, a “cobrizo,”
first introduced in the preceding book and symbolizing the
inertia of the native. In the second book, however, the
ideas are anything but those of inertia; Lobato has got
into the skin of the fisherman and produced a series of admirable
essays and critiques. Of similar nature are the
chapters embodied in <i>Cidades Mortas</i>. <i>Negrinha</i> is a
collection of short stories. In addition to being the
author of these books, he is the editor of a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
magazine, <i>Revista do Brazil</i>, the publisher of volumes by the
rising generation of literary redeemers, instructor to his
nation in hygiene, and his energies flow over into yet
other channels. He is also the writer of several books
for children. The best known of these is <i>Narizinho
Arrebitado</i> or, as who should say <i>Little Snub-Nose</i>, and
with an appropriate blush I confess that the little girl’s
adventures among the flowers and creatures of her native
land were responsible for the theft of some hours
from the study of fatter, less childish, tomes. As one
who would renovate the letters of his nation, Lobato naturally
has much to say, inside of Brazil and outside, of
the former and present figures of the country’s literature.
His work in every phase is first of all an act of nationalism.</p>

<p>From the exclusive stylistic standpoint Lobato is
terse, vigorous, intense, to the point. The chapters devoted
to the creation of a style (in <i>Jéca Tatú</i>) form a
valid plea for a genuinely autochthonous art, and it is instructive
to see how he treats the question in its relation
to architecture. Brazil has native flora, fauna and mythology
which its writers are neglecting for the repetition
of the hackneyed hosts of Hellas. (Yet Lobato
nods betimes and sees the Laocoön in a gnarled tree.)
He is an “anti-literary” writer, scorning the finer graces,
yet, besides betraying acute consciousness of being a
writer, he employs situations that have been overdone
time and again, and worse still, in plots that are no more
Brazilian than they are Magyar or Senegalese. Thus, in
<i>O Bugio Moqueado</i> we encounter a tale of a woman
forced daily to eat a dish prepared by her vindictive
husband from the slain body of her lover. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
characteristic that the Brazilian author heaps the horror generously,
without at all adding to the effect of the theme
as it appears in Greek mythology or in the lore of old
Provence.</p>

<p>The truth would seem to be that at bottom Lobato
is not a teller of stories but a critic of men. His vein
is distinctly satiric, ironic; he has the gift of the caricaturist,
and that is why so often his tales run either into
sentimentality or into the macabrous. When he tells
a tale of horror, it is not the uncannily graduated art of
a Poe, but rather the thing itself that is horrible. His
innate didactic tendency reveals itself not only in his
frankly didactic labours, but in his habit of prefixing to
his tales a philosophical, commentative prelude. Because
he is a well-read, cosmopolitan person, his tales
and comments often possess that worldly significance
which no amount of regional outlook can wholly obscure;
but because he is so intent upon sounding the national
note he spoils much of his writing by stepping onto the
pages in his own person.</p>

<p>At his best he suggests the arrival in Brazilian literature
of a fresh, spontaneous, creative power. Tales
like <i>A Modern Torture</i> (in which a rural dabbler in
politics, weary of his postal delivery “job,” turns
traitor to the old party and helps elect the new, only
to be “rewarded” with the same old “job”) are rare
in any tongue and would not be out of place in a collection
by Chekhov or Twain. Here is humour served by&mdash;and
not in the service of&mdash;nation, nature and man.
Similarly <i>Choo-Pan!</i> with its humorous opening and
gradual progress to the grim close, shows what can be
done when a writer becomes the master and not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
slave of indigenous legend. A comparison of this tale
with a similar one, <i>The Tree That Kills</i>, may bring
out the author’s weakness and his strength. In the first,
under peculiar circumstances, a man meets his death
through a tree that, according to native belief, avenges
the hewing down of its fellow. In the second, the <i>Tree
That Kills</i> is explained as a sort of preface, then follows
a tale of human beings in which a foster-child, like
the <i>Tree That Kills</i>, eats his way into the love of a childless
pair, only first to betray the husband and then, after
wearying of the woman, to attempt her life as well. The
first story, besides being well told, is made to appear intimately
Brazilian; the death of the man, who is a sot
and has so bungled his work that the structure was bound
to topple over, is natural, and actual belief in the legend
is unnecessary; it colours the tale and lends atmosphere.
<i>The Tree That Kills</i>, on the other hand, is merely another
tale of the domestic triangle, no more Brazilian
than anything else, with a twist of retribution at the end
that must have appealed to the preacher hidden in Lobato;
the analogy of the foster-son to the tree is not an
integral part of the tale; the story, in fact, is added to
the explanation of the tree parasite and is itself parasitical.</p>

<p>Lobato’s attitude toward education may be gleaned
from his child’s book <i>Little Snub-Nose</i> and the epigraph
from Anatole France. He wishes to cultivate the imagination
rather than cram the intellect. And even in
this second reader for public schools&mdash;refreshingly free
of the “I-see-a-cat” method&mdash;one can catch now and then
his intention of instructing and satirizing the elder population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>To this caustic spirit, the real Brazil&mdash;the Brazil that
must set to work stamping its impress upon the arts of
the near future&mdash;lies in the interior of the country.
There he finds the genuine Brazilian, uncontaminated
by the “esperanto of ideas and customs” characteristic
of the centres that receive immigration from all over the
world. There he discovers the raw material for the real
national art, as distinguished from cities with their phantasmagoria
of foreign importations. And for that art
of the interior he has found the great precursor in
Euclydes da Cunha&mdash;a truly remarkable writer upon
whom the wandering Scot, Richard Cunninghame-Graham,
drew abundantly, as we have seen, in his rare work
upon that Brazilian mystic and fanatic, Antonio Conselheiro.
“It was Euclydes da Cunha,” writes Lobato in his
<i>Idéas de Jéca Tatú</i>, “who opened for us, in his <i>Sertões</i>,
the gates to the interior of the country. The Frenchified
Brazilian of the coast cities was astonished. Could there,
then, be so many strong, heroic, unpublished, formidable
things back there?… He revealed us to ourselves.
We saw that Brazil isn’t São Paulo, with its Italian contingent,
nor Rio, with its Portuguese. Art beheld new
perspectives opened to it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To present a notion of Monteiro Lobato’s style and
his general outlook, I shall confine myself to translating
an excerpt or two from his most pithy volume,
<i>Idéas de Jéca Tatú</i>.</p>

<p>One of the pivotal essays is that entitled <i>Esthetica
Official</i> (Official Esthetics). “The work of art,” it
begins, “is indicated by its coefficient of temperament,
color and life&mdash;the three values that produce its unity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
deriving the one from man, the other from milieu, the
third from the moment. Art that flees this tripod of
categories and that has as its human-factor the <i>heimatlos</i>
person (the man of many countries brought into
evidence by the war); that has as <i>terroir</i> the world and
as epoch all Time, will be a superb creation when volapuk
rules over the globe: until then, no!</p>

<p>“Whence we derive a logical conclusion: the artist
grows in proportion as he becomes nationalized. The
work of art must reveal to the quickest glance its origin,
just as the races denote their ethnological group through
the individual type.”</p>

<p>Yet note how Lobato, for all his nationalism, in the
very paragraph that opens his somewhat uncritical critique,
employs a German word, soon followed by a
French, and all this a few seconds before ridiculing volapuk!
Not that this need necessarily vitiate his argument,
which has, to my way of thinking, far stronger points
against it. But it does serve to indicate, I believe, that the
world has grown too small for the artificial insistence
upon a nationalism in literature which only too often
proves the disguise of our primitive, unreasoned loyalties.
Lobato’s unconscious use of these foreign terms
provided, at the very moment he was denying it, a proof
of the interpenetration of alien cultures. He has, too
strongly for art as we now understand it, the regional
outlook; for him Brazil is not the Brazil that we
know on the map, or know as a political entity; it is
the interior. His very nationalism refers, in this aspect,
to but part of his own nation, though, to be fair,
it is his theory that sins more seriously than his practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nietzsche,” he says elsewhere in the book, “served
here as a pollen. It is the mission of Nietzsche to fecundate
whatever he touches. No one leaves him shaped
in the uniformity of a certain mould; he leaves free, he
leaves as <i>himself</i>. (The italics are Lobato’s.) His
aphorism&mdash;<i>Vademecum? Vadetecum!</i>&mdash;is the kernel of
a liberating philosophy. Would you follow me? Follow
yourself!” Now this, allowing for the personal
modifications Nietzsche himself concentrates into his
crisp question and answer, is the attitude of an Ibsen, a
Wagner; in the new world, of a Darío, of a Rodó, and
of all true leaders, who would lead their followers to
self-leadership. And once again Lobato answers himself
with his own citations, for he himself, showing the
effect of Nietzsche upon certain of the Brazilian writers&mdash;a
liberating effect, and one which helped them to a
realization of their own personalities&mdash;produces the most
telling of arguments in favour of legitimate foreign influences.</p>

<p>His characteristic attitude of indignation crops out
at every turn. In an essay upon <i>A Estatua do Patriarcha</i>,
dedicated to the noble figure of José Bonifacio de Andrade,
he gives a patient summary of the man’s achievements&mdash;as
patient as his nervous manner and his trenchant
language can accomplish. As he approaches his
climax, he becomes almost telegraphic:</p>

<p>“He (that is, Bonifacio) works in the dark.</p>

<p>“His strength is faith.</p>

<p>“His arms, suggestion.</p>

<p>“His target, the cry of Ipiranga.</p>

<p>“The work that he is then accomplishing is too intense
not to sweep aside all obstacles thrust in his path; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
power of suggestion is too strong not to conquer the
Prince Regent; his look too firm for the shot not to hit
the bull’s eye.</p>

<p>“He conquered.</p>

<p>“The fatherland went into housekeeping for itself and
it was he who ordered the arrangement of all the furniture
and the standards of a free life.</p>

<p>“This is José Bonifacio’s zenith. He is the Washington
of the South.<a name="FNanchor_1_145" id="FNanchor_1_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_145" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>“Less fortunate, however, than Washington, he afterwards
sees the country take a direction that he foresaw
was mistaken.</p>

<p>“He starts a struggle against the radical currents
and against evil men.</p>

<p>“He loses the contest.…</p>

<p>“Brought to trial as a conspirator, he was absolved.</p>

<p>“He betook himself to the island of Paquetá and in
1838 died in the city of Nitheroy.</p>

<p>“There you have José Bonifacio.”</p>

<p>There, incidentally, you have Monteiro Lobato, in the
quivering vigour of the phrase, in the emotional concentration.
But all this has been but the preparation for
Lobato’s final coup.</p>

<p>“José Bonifacio is, beyond dispute, the greatest figure
in our history.</p>

<p>“Very well: this man was a Paulist, (i. e., a native
of São Paulo). Born in Santos, in 1763. It is already
a century since the Paulists were struck with the idea of
rearing him a statue. Not that he needs the monument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
In a most grandiose manner he reared one to himself
in the countless scientific memoirs that he published in
Europe, the greater part in German, never translated into
his own tongue,&mdash;and in his fecund political action in
favour of the <i>fiat</i> of nationality.</p>

<p>“It is we who need the monument, for its absence
covers us with shame and justifies the curse which from
his place of exile he cast upon the evil persons of the
day.…”</p>

<p>Now, Monteiro Lobato’s nationalism, as I try to show,
is not the narrow cause that his theoretical writings would
seem to indicate. It is, as I said at the beginning, really
an evidence of his eagerness for the expansion of personality.
But it is contaminated&mdash;and I believe that is the
proper word&mdash;by an intense local pride which vents itself,
upon occasion, as local scolding. The entire essay upon
José Bonifacio was written for the sake of the final
sting. Not so much to exalt the great figure as to glorify
São Paulo and at the same time excoriate the forgetful,
the negligent Paulistas. It is such writing as this that
best reveals Lobato because it best expresses his central
passion, which is not the cult of artistic beauty but the
criticism of social failings.</p>

<p>This is at once a step backward and a step forward.
Forward in the civic sense, because Brazil needs the unflattering
testimony of its own more exigent sons and
daughters,&mdash;and is Brazil alone in this need? Backward
in the artistic sense, because it tends to a confusion
of values. It vitiates, particularly in Lobato, the tales
he tells until it is difficult to say whether the tale points
a moral or the moral adorns the tale.</p>

<p>That Lobato is alive to the genuineness of legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
foreign influence he himself shows as well as any critic
can for him, in the essay upon <i>A Questão do Estylo</i> (The
Question of Style), in a succinct paragraph upon Olavo
Bilac’s poem <i>O Caçador de Esmeraldas</i>. “The poet
… when he composed The Emerald-Hunter, did not
take from Corneille a single word, nor from Anatole a
single conceit, nor a night from Musset, nor a cock from
Rostand, nor frigidity from Leconte, nor an acanthus
from Greece, nor a virtue from Rome. But, without
wishing it, from the very fact that he was a modern open
to all the winds that blow, he took from Corneille the
purity of language, from Musset poesy, from Leconte
elegance, from Greece the pure line, from Rome fortitude
of soul&mdash;and with the ancient-rough he made the new-beautiful.”</p>

<p>But what, he asks, shall we say of a poem composed of
ill-assimilated suggestions from without,&mdash;“in unskilled
adaptations of foreign verses, and with types of all the
races? The ‘qu’il mourût’ of Corneille in the mouth of
a João Fernandez, who slays Ninon, mistress of the
colonel José da Silva e Souza, consul of Honduras in
Thibet, because an Egyptian fellah disagreed with Ibsen
as to the action of Descartes in the battle of Charleroi?…”</p>

<p>Even such a mixture does Lobato discover in the architecture
of latter-day São Paulo. But more to our present
point: note how, as long as Lobato sticks to actual
example, his nationalism is a reasoned, cautious application.
As soon as he deserts fact for theory he steps into
caricature; nor is it, perhaps, by mere coincidence that
the longest essay in the book is upon Caricature in
Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no question as to the dynamic personality
of this young man. There can be little question as
to the wholesome influence he is wielding. Thus far,
however, he is weakest when in his rôle as short-story
writer&mdash;with the important exceptions we have noted&mdash;and
strongest as a polemical critic. His personal gifts
seem destined to make of him a propagandist of the
ironical, satirical sort, with a marked inclination for caricature.
One may safely hazard the opinion that he has
not yet, in the creative sense&mdash;that of transforming reality,
through imagination, into artistic life&mdash;found himself
fully. He is much more than a promise; it is only that
his fulfilment is not yet clearly defined.<a name="FNanchor_2_146" id="FNanchor_2_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_146" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_146" id="Footnote_2_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_146"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Some time after writing the article of which the above is an amplification,
I received from Senhor Lobato a letter which is of sufficient importance
to contemporary strivings in Brazil, and to the life and purpose
of Lobato himself, to merit partial translation. I give the salient
passages herewith:
</p>
<p>
“I was born on the 18th April, 1883, in Taubate, State of São Paulo,
the son of parents who owned a coffee estate. I initiated my studies in
that city and proceeded later to São Paulo, where I entered the department
of Law, being graduated, like everybody else, as a Bachelor of
Laws. Fond of literature, I read a great deal in my youth; my favourite
authors were Kipling, Maupassant, Tolstoi, Dostoievsky, Balzac,
Wells, Dickens, Camillo Castello Branco, Eça de Queiroz and Machado
de Assis … but I never let myself be dominated by any one. I like to
see with my own eyes, smell with my own nose. All my work reveals
this personal impression, almost always cruel, for, in my opinion, we are
the remnant of a race approaching elimination. Brazil will be something
in the future, but the man of today, the Luso-Africano-Indio will pass
out of existence, absorbed and eliminated by other, stronger races …
just as the primitive aborigine passed. Even as the Portuguese caused
the disappearance of the Indian, so will the new races cause the disappearance
of the hybrid Portuguese, whose rôle in Brazilian civilization
is already fulfilled, having consisted of the vast labour of clearing the
land by the destruction of the forests. The language will remain, gradually
more and more modified by the influence of the new milieu, so
different from the Lusitanian milieu.
</p>
<p>
“Brazil is an ailing country.” (In his pamphlet <i>Problema Vital</i>, Lobato
studies this problem, indicating that man will be victorious over
the tropical zone through the new arms of hygiene. The pamphlet caused
a turmoil throughout Brazil, and sides were at once formed, the one
considering Lobato a defamer of the nation, the other seeing in it an
act of sanative patriotism. As a result, a national program of sanitation
was inaugurated. This realism of approach, so characteristic of Lobato,
made of his figure Jéca Tatú a national symbol that has in many minds
replaced the idealized image of <i>Pery</i>, from Alencar’s <i>Guarany</i>. <i>Jéca</i> thus
stands for the most recent critical reaction against national romanticism.)
</p>
<p>
“I recognize now that I was cruel, but it was the only way of stirring
opinion in that huge whale of most rudimentary nervous system which
is my poor Brazil. I am not properly a literary man. I take no pleasure
in writing, nor do I attach the slightest importance to what is called
literary glory and similar follies. I am a particle of extremely sensitive
conscience that adopted the literary form,&mdash;fiction, the conte, satire,&mdash;as
the only means of being heard and heeded. I achieved my aim and
today I devote myself to the publishing business, where I find a solid
means of sustaining the great idea that in order to cure an ailing person
he must first be convinced that he is, in fact, a sick man.”
</p>
<p>
Here, as elsewhere, Lobato’s theory is harsher than his practice. He
is, of course, a literary man and has achieved a distinctive style; but he
knows, as his letter hints, that his social strength is his literary weakness.</p>

<h2><a name="SELECTIVE_CRITICAL_BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="SELECTIVE_CRITICAL_BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>SELECTIVE CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>As the purpose of this book is largely introductory, the works
listed below have been chosen carefully as a miniature critical
library for the student. Numerous other volumes are mentioned
in the footnotes of the text. I have not considered it necessary to
include here a number of works that possess importance chiefly for
the specialist.</p>

<p>FERDINAND DENIS. <i>Resumé de l’histoire littéraire du
Portugal, suivi du Resumé de l’histoire littéraire du
Brésil.</i> Paris, 1826.</p>

<p>The chapters upon Brazilian letters occupy pages 513
to 601 of this 16mo book. The French cleric, with a style
inclining toward eloquence, makes highly pleasant reading,
and the century that followed upon his work has borne out
more than one of his expectations. He realized, thus
early, the effect of the racial blend upon the imaginative
output, indicating the African for ardour, the Portuguese
for chivalry, the Indian native for dreaminess. As a
resident upon the spot, he noted the several-month droughts
which Buckle, much to Romero’s indignation, later failed
to take into account. “America,” wrote Denis, “sparkling
with youth, ought to think thoughts as new and energetic
as itself; our literary glory cannot always illumine it with
a light that grows dim on crossing the seas, and which
should vanish completely before the primitive inspiration
of a nation vibrant with energy.” Denis, in his prophetic
strain, even predicted that America would some day visit
Europe as Europe today visits Egypt, to witness the scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of a departed civilization. In general, he favours a distinctive,
national note. He is cursorily informative rather
than critical, and susceptible to few aesthetic values.</p>

<p>FERDINAND WOLF. <i>Le Brésil Littéraire. Histoire de la
littérature brésilienne suivie d’un choix de morceaux tires
des meilleurs auteurs b(r)ésiliens.</i> Berlin, 1863.</p>

<p>The quarto volume is dedicated to the Emperor of
Brazil. Wolf, of course, was a German; the book was
translated into French at the publisher’s request, in order
to reach a larger audience. Its author regarded it as “the
first and only one to appear in Europe on the subject.”
Since Denis’s treatment forms a sort of appendix to his
Portuguese section, Wolf’s statement, understood as referring
to an independent volume upon Brazil, may be
allowed to pass. The book is chiefly one of facts and
analyses of works. Of criticism in the higher sense there
is little, and what there is, is of the conventional sort.
There is a moral, anti-French outlook; a Teutonic preoccupation
with data; no glimmer of aesthetic criticism.
Wolf’s style is far from the amenable style of Denis.</p>

<p>FRANCISCO ADOLPHO DE VARNHAGEN. <i>Florilegio
da Poesia Brasileira.</i> (Vols. I and II, Lisbon, 1850.
Vol. III, Madrid, 1853.)</p>

<p>It is the <i>Introduction</i> preceding the first volume of these
noted selections, together with the prefatory notes to the
selections themselves, that virtually begins the writing of
Brazilian literary history. Without this work Ferdinand
Wolf could not have written his <i>Le Brésil Littéraire</i>. All
later investigators and critics have really built upon
Varnhagen’s foundations, tearing a stone away here and
there and substituting another, but leaving the structure
fundamentally the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>SYLVIO ROMERO. <i>Historia da Litteratura Brasileira. 2a
edição, melhorada pelo auctor.</i> Rio Vol. I, 1902, Vol.
II, 1903.</p>

<p>Romero is one of the most picturesque literary figures
of the nineteenth century. He was a born fighter, with all
the traits of the ardent polemist. Throughout a lifetime
that was rife with self-contradiction, self-repetition, and
self-glorification, he fought for Brazilian independence in
the literary, scientific and political fields. He was by no
means blind to esthetic beauty, but he insisted overmuch
upon the national element and was easily lost in fogs of irrelevancy.
He was a great admirer of German methods,
and&mdash;justly, to my way of thinking&mdash;a believer in Anglo-German
culture as a complement to Latin. As his life
sought to cover almost every field of intellectual activity, so
does his History of Brazilian Literature, which was left incompleted,
seek to cover altogether too much ground. His
book might more properly have been named a history of
Brazilian culture. Such, indeed, was his conception of literature,
which to him, as he states in his very first chapter,
possessed “the amplitude given to it by the critics and historians
of Germany. It comprises all the manifestations of
a people’s intelligence:&mdash;politics, economics, art, popular creations,
sciences … and not, as was wont to be supposed,
in Brazil, only those entitled <i>belles lettres</i>, which finally
came to mean almost exclusively <i>poetry</i>!…” A knowledge
of this important work&mdash;important despite the list of
objections that might be raised against it&mdash;is indispensable
to the student.</p>

<p>SYLVIO ROMERO and JOAO RIBEIRO. <i>Compendia da
Literatura Brasileira.</i> 2a edição refundida. Rio, 1909.</p>

<p>A useful compendium and condensation. The authors
here consider art “a chapter of sociology,” laying down a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
belief in the “consciousness of the identity of human
destinies,” which is, “in our opinion, the basis of all sociology
and morality.”</p>

<p>JOSÉ VERISSIMO. <i>Estudos de Literatura Brazileira.</i> Six
series, published at Rio de Janeiro and Paris, between
1901 and 1910. These largely formed the basis for his
<i>Historia da Literatura Brazileira</i>, Rio, 1916.</p>

<p>Verissimo, in my opinion, is the leading critic of letters
Brazil has thus far produced, and one of the country’s
greatest minds. His whole life was a beautiful attitude,&mdash;a
serene, usually unruffled spirit open to anything that
proceeded from creative sincerity. He is, as I have tried
to show in the text, the spiritual opposite of Romero. If
the student has time only for a limited reading of Brazilian
criticism, he should approach Verissimo before he goes any
farther. Verissimo had learned, or perhaps had been born
with, the secret that beauty owed allegiance to no flag;
he was not bogged, as was Romero so often, by extraneous
loyalties; he erected no pompous structures of “scientificist”
criticism. He was, what every significant critic must be,
an artist.</p>

<p>RONALD DE CARVALHO. <i>Pequena Historia da Literatura
Brasileira.</i> Rio, 1919, 1922. The book was awarded
a prize by the Brazilian Academy&mdash;as was the same
author’s book of poetry <i>Poemas e Sonetos</i>&mdash;and appeared
later in a revised, augmented edition. De Carvalho is
a brilliant young man on the sunny side of thirty. His
book&mdash;as, for that matter, every other recent one upon
the subject&mdash;is under great debts to Romero and Verissimo,
but it reveals an independent personality and an
agreeably cosmopolitan conception of literature.</p>

<p>For the facts&mdash;as distinguished from opinions&mdash;in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
own book I have relied largely upon the works of Romero,
Verissimo, Lima and Carvalho. The number of lesser
books that may be read is far greater than their individual
worth. I would suggest, merely as a starting-point for
more individual delving, such informative books as the
following:</p>

<p>VICTOR ORBAN. <i>Le Brésil Litteraire.</i> Paris, no date. An
anthology with many illustrations of authors.</p>

<p>M. GARCIA MEROU. <i>El Brasil Intelectual.</i> A highly diverting
account by an Argentine who was once Minister
to the United States.</p>

<p>ENRIQUE BUSTAMANTE Y BALLIVIAN. <i>Poetas Brasileros.</i>
Rio, 1922. A translation into Spanish of a
number of poems representing the various movements
since (and including) Romanticism. Bustamante is a
Peruvian poet of worth and has added short notes to his
selections.</p>

<p>LIVRO DO CENTENARIO. Rio, 1900. As part of the celebration
of the 400th anniversary of Brazil’s discovery, the
government has sponsored the publication of four tomes,
which covered the culture of the nation. Volume I
contains a resumé of Brazilian literature by the ubiquitous
Romero, in which he slashes through the field in
characteristic fashion.</p>

<p>Very little has been translated into English from the Brazilian
authors, particularly in the United States. As an example of the
novel, there is, however, Aranha’s <i>Chanaan</i>, issued as <i>Canaan</i> in
Boston, 1919. In Boston, too, 1921, was issued <i>Brazilian Tales</i>,
containing short stories from Machado de Assis, Coelho Netto,
Medeiros e Albuquerque and Carmen Dolores. Coelho’s fine
